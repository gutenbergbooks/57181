<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>WENTY-FIVE years ago, when a lad fifteen years old attending the public
schools of Pennsylvania, in which State I was born and reared, certain
ideas and sentiments caused me to secretly resolve that some day, when I
had gotten together the necessary data, I would write just such a book
as is contained herein. At the time that resolution was formed, I was
attending the Darlington School in Middletown District, Delaware County
over which Prof. A. G. C. Smith was Superintendent. And I remember with
much gratefulness my first and last public school teachers, Misses
Carrie V. Hamilton and Rebecca R. Crumley and Prof. Smith for their kind
and frequent words to me as encouragement to continue my education after
graduating from the public schools.</p>

<p>My favorite study was the United States History, and even at the tender
age of fifteen years, I was greatly surprised and Race pridely hurt not
to find any history, except about slavery, in such books concerning the
American Negro. I had such childish confidence in my school books and
their authors that I felt sure if Negroes had fought and died in the
several American wars; had become great poets, orators, artists,
sculptors, etc., the histories I was studying would have mentioned such.
I thought in doing that they would have been preserving United States
valuable history more so than merely giving just credit to the Colored
people who had made such history. I did not know that right then the
attentions of many public school<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> children in far away Europe were often
called to the histories of such distinguished Colored Americans as
Phyllis Wheatley, the poetess; Frederick Douglas, the orator; Henry O.
Tanner, the artist; Edmonia Lewis, the sculptoress&mdash;all of them having
won recognition and fame in Europe as well as in America.</p>

<p>My youthful ignorance, regarding the achievements of my race, is easily
explained when it is taken into consideration that I was a farmer boy
living far from libraries I had never seen and Negro histories I had
never heard about. And the United States histories then used in the
public schools had nothing in them to enlighten me on that subject. They
misled and kept me, along with thousands of other Colored school
children, in absolute ignorance relative to the progress and attainments
of the American Colored people. So whenever our history classes went up
to recite and my white classmates proudly went through the lessons about
General George Washington, Noah Webster, Benjamin Franklin, Eli Whitney,
Longfellow, etc., while I knew and could just as easily recite such
history, nevertheless, my feelings of crushed race pride and
mortification were beyond expression because not one thing could I
proudly recite from my lessons about great things my people had
accomplished in America.</p>

<p>It is the same with the United States histories used in our public
schools of today. They do not relate about Crispus Attucks, a Negro
soldier and the first Colonist martyr to give his life for America in
the Revolutionary War; nor about the Colored sailor, William Tillman,
who received six thousand dollars from the Federal Government for
recapturing a stolen schooner from the Rebels in the Civil War; nor
about the Colored Registrars of the United States Treasury, B. K. Bruce,
J. W. Lyons, W. T. Vernon and J. C. Napier, whose names, during
different administrations covering a period of more than thirty years,
appeared on all the United States paper money made and issued during
that period; nor about Matthew A. Henson, who was with Commodore Peary
when he (Peary) discovered the North Pole; nor about Booker T.
Washington, one of the greatest orators America has ever produced and
also<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> builder of one of the most famous institutions of learning not
only in America but in the world.</p>

<p>As I said before, I knew nothing about such Negro history while I was a
farmer’s boy, but I could never quite rid myself of a feeling that the
Colored people in the United States did have a worthy history. I studied
the white man’s U. S. History from cover to cover and learned all I
could from it, but I got no more racial inspiration from it than a white
boy would get from studying only a Negro history in which nothing was
written about his own racial achievements. So I secretly resolved to
immediately begin to quietly and patiently research for American Negro
data in order to some day publish a book so that future Colored school
children would not be kept in ignorance about their own race history. I
felt it was perfectly right and necessary to study the white man’s
history at the school desks, but if Colored children were not permitted
to study the history of their own race at the same desks, it was
perfectly right and necessary that Colored children learn about the
achievements of their great men and women at their home firesides within
their family circles.</p>

<p>So for the benefit mostly of Colored youths, here are the crude results
of my boyhood resolutions and manhood efforts after twenty-five years
filled with trying discouragements, and bitter disappointments, but also
just as full of unswerving determinations, constant hopefulness, upward
climbs, ceaseless works and fervent prayers to God to succeed.</p>

<p>The author wishes to use this place and opportunity to express his
deepest thanks to the more than one hundred prominent Colored men and
women, living in as many large cities in all parts of the United States,
who so friendly sent to him up-to-date information regarding the
progress and success of Colored people in those cities.</p>

<p>For the unusual generosity and kindness in giving of their valuable time
to personally and helpfully send to him exceptionally fitting and
authentic Negro data, the writer most courteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span>ly acknowledges and

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>VER three hundred years ago (1619) Africans were first brought as
“Negro Servants” (Ref. Prof. Monroe N. Work’s Negro Year Book; page 153,
1918-1919 edition) to the early colonies of the United States by the
captain of a Dutch ship who sold twenty Negroes to white plantation
owners at Jamestown, Virginia. As the results of those and many other
native Africans being later captured and forcibly brought to America,
real slavery was finally started and spread so rapidly that there were
about four million slaves in the United States by January 1, 1863. At
that time all the slaves in the Rebel states were set free by the
Emancipation Proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln, who was later
murdered for that Godly act by one of his own race. But today Abraham
Lincoln is remembered in all civilized countries as one of the greatest
among the greatest men the world has ever known; as the noblest
president who has ever governed the United States and as the truest and
most fair-minded white friend the Negro race has ever had. On December
18, 1865 the adoption of the 13th Amendment to The Constitution of the
United States gave freedom to the remaining slaves who lived in the
states that had not rebelled against the Union. Thus in these two legal
ways, that were made possible by the Northern States winning the Civil
War, were all the slaves in the United States of America set free.</p>

<p>When the few broad-minded white people in the early colonies stopped to
realize that the first African people who arrived were not used to
America’s new foods, unusual hard work, cold changeable climates and
were without a knowledge of the white ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span>n’s language, habits and
religion; it is no great wonder why that small portion of justice
thinking white people so readily saw unusual good qualities and latent
talents in a group of supposed brainless heathens who so quickly,
peacefully and profitably stepped from the narrow paths of African
savagery into the broad avenues of American civilization. But the large
numbers of narrow-minded people, who then (as now) tried so hard to make
themselves and others believe that Negroes were inferior human beings to
themselves, put forth the explanation that the remarkable and rapid
adjustments of the slaves to American surroundings were due to their
childlike dispositions to imitate actions, to humbly obey orders and
their great physical strength to do all kinds of hard work at all times
under all conditions. Such people were entirely wrong in such ideas,
just as all ill-meaning prejudiced ideas keep their owners wrong, mean
and in the lowest stages of human society. When men and women allow
their minds to become poisoned with hateful, envious and jealous
prejudice toward other people and refuse to have anything to do with
them because they are Colored, they have and show just about as much
greatness in good taste and good common-sense as if they were to refuse
to puff on their favorite brand of Havana cigars or to nibble on one of
Mr. Huyler’s famed chocolate bon-bons just because the cigar and bon-bon
are of rich brown colors. Such narrow-minded actions do not make people
great except in their own home-town little social circles. And when they
leave home and go out into the world to mingle among well-cultured,
highly educated and broad-minded people, prejudiced men and women soon
find that their supposed greatness along side of, for instance, an
Abraham Lincoln or a Harriet Beecher Stowe[A] is as large as a grain of
sand is along side of a mountain. If President Lincoln had not preserved
the Union and signed the Emancipation Proclamation, or if Mrs. Stowe had
not written Uncle Tom’s Cabin,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> but instead, both had turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> up their
noses in disdain, tossed their heads in haughty proudness and snobbishly
spurned well-behaved, well-dressed and intelligent people just because
of their colors; the names of Lincoln and Stowe (in stead of now being
enshrined in the Hall Of Fame and written in the world’s history ever to
be remembered and beloved by all nations) would have been buried and
forgotten a few years after their owners had died as is the case with
the names of all race prejudiced people. But this point regarding the
utter foolishness and ignorance of people showing race prejudice was
much more ably and vividly brought out in one of Mr. McKay’s
bull’s-eye-shot and soul-stirring pictures that appear in the Sunday
issues of the New York American&mdash;one among several such big white
journals from which the writer derives new inspiration and increased
knowledge every Sunday. This picture and editorial in question, that
described the “Namaqua” savage tribe of Negroes living in the African
jungles, were printed in the March 6, 1921 issue of the New York
American, and the following is an extract from that article titled
“Shooting At The Storm.”</p>

<p>“The savages of Africa had first of all to fight and conquer the burning
sun, hence the black skin that keeps off the deadly “actinic rays” that
would quickly destroy any white race in their climate, and the thick
woolly hair, saturated with grease, protecting the skull from the heat
and the deadly effect of those same rays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span></p>

<p>“As we think of different kinds of human beings, let us judge them by
the conditions under which they live, whether they be Eskimos near the
North Pole or men like these Namaquas at the Equator.</p>

<p>“Self-satisfied ignorance is horrified at the Eskimo eating enormous
quantities of rank, fat whale blubber. Any race transferred to the
Arctic Circle would do that or die. Ignorance despises the black skin
and woolly hair of the African. Any white race transferred to the
African tropics would develop such skin and hair, or it would die.</p>

<p>“UNDERSTAND what you are discussing, as far as possible, before
discussing it. An eagle cannot understand a turtle, or a turtle an
eagle. And a cow, mildly grazing, cannot understand either. Every human
being that despises another, no matter what the other may be, simply
represents the animal expression of prejudice based on ignorance.”</p>

<p>Now the real truth, as to how those strange and friendless slaves were
able to so readily adapt themselves to this country and so aptly adopt
the methods and customs of the colonists, is that from mere force of
habits they put into their everyday lives their inherited qualities of
open-friendliness, big-heartedness, broad-mindedness, trustworthiness,
constant-loyalty, quick-alertness, unbounded-patience,
everready-forgivefulness and undying hopefulness. These qualities (in
which all civilized countries of today stand badly in need of a much
broader growth and a higher culture) had been handed down to the
American slaves by their African forefathers who had for centuries dwelt
in the darkest and wildest torrid jungles without a knowledge of the
white man’s civilization. And those black ancestors had passed to their
suffering offsprings such full portions of the above named manhood and
brotherhood principles that the slaves were able, as they pitifully and
tearfully went back and forth to their body-torturing and
spirit-crushing tasks, to shame, by their unspiteful and unrevengeful
actions under such cruel treatments, just a little measure of their
inherited virtues into the so-called civilized, educated and Christian
white people who held them in bondage. It must be granted that their
owners did teach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span> slaves (whose foreparents had lived in a very hot
country where little clothing was needed and food was plentiful without
working for it) how to properly dress and how to regularly work. And
although those enslaved people were taught those good habits only as
means for their selfish and greedy owners to enable themselves to get
richer, nevertheless, the Colored people of to-day are glad and thankful
that they are now able to turn to their own personal and racial
advantages the industrial habits learned by their people in slavery. On
the other hand, Colored people will always be sorry and unthankful to
those brute overseers and raping slave owners who so sinfully and
beastfully forced upon and taught numerous and most harmful immoral
vices to their slaves. And those soul-damning and life-sapping vices are
still clinging to and leaving their marks on the rapidly advancing
Colored people, just as the poison ivy clings to and mars the health and
beauty of the young and tender acorn sprouts as they struggle upward to
become future majestic oaks in the densely foliaged forests.</p>

<p>However, all of the white people in America at that time did not approve
of or own slaves (just as all of the white people in the United States
today do not approve of nor take part in discriminating against
respectable Colored people) because they knew it was not right. They had
the kind of Christianity that was real and pure enough to make their
minds fully understand and their hearts to tenderly feel that slavery in
its kindest manner is the worse sin against God and the greatest crime
against humanity. And it was this class of God-serving and
fellowman-loving white men and women who secretly and in great danger of
being caught and punished (for the laws of the country forbid the
educating of slaves) taught the otherwise friendless people in bondage
their first knowledge of God and Jesus Christ. When it is remembered
that those African people were just a few years out of a land where the
practices of their tribes for centuries had been to worship in a
different religion; it is easily seen that the slaves were an unusual
reasoning, sensible and broad-minded group of uncivilized people to have
so quickly found the mistake in and so suddenly thrown aside their old
and false religion and so readily accepted in its place the new and true
Faith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span></p><h3>Answered Prayers</h3>

<p>During the two hundred and forty-four years of their bitter servitude
those shackled people had learned to place so much faith and trust in
their newly found religion that they felt sure God in his own wisdom,
time and manner would hear and answer their usually silent and always
heart-rending prayers for deliverance from slavery.</p>

<p>So as Southern heats washed briny sweat into their sun-dazed eyes, or
Northern colds checked frozen blood from flowing through their veins;
the hopeful prayers of the slaves, that they and their children might
some day become free, were constantly offered up from the tobacco
plantations of Virginia; from the cotton belts of Alabama, Georgia and
Mississippi; from the corn fields of Tennessee and Texas; from the rice
swamps of South Carolina; from the orange groves of Florida; from the
stone quarries of Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania; from the
truck farms of Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey; from the turpentine
forests of North Carolina; from the blue grass meadows of Kentucky; from
the fishing banks of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island and
from the cane-brakes of Louisiana.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Colored people of today, as they patiently and gradually
draw themselves up and away from the slum and slime of slavery, are
constantly sending up to Heaven from the east, the west, the north and
the south points of this country their hopeful and earnest prayers that
God in His mysterious way will convert and bring back to Christianity
those prejudiced, heathenish and uncivilized members of the Caucasian
race who persecute and discriminate against all darker races just on
account of their progress. As living witnesses and proofs that such
prayers are already being duly heard and daily answered by God, the
author will tell on the following pages of this book (mainly for the
inspiration of Colored boys and girls so that they will not lose
confidence in themselves, trust in mankind and faith in God) just a
little of the remarkable progress and success made by the American
Colored people during their fifty-eight years of freedom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span></p>

<p>But the Negro youths who read these following pages should ever bear in
mind that the members of their race who have climbed and mounted these
rounds of success have only been able to do so through the guidance and
care of God; through the unswerving determinations and ceaseless
struggles on the part of themselves and through the hearty good-will and
brotherhood helpfulness of the thousands of American white people who
are today true and loyal friends of the American Colored people.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span>LTHOUGH such records cannot be found on the pages of the United States
histories used in the American public schools, a trip to cultured Boston
will enable one to read on the monuments in public squares and in the
public libraries the name and facts about the glorious deeds of that
pioneer Negro patriot, Crispus Attucks who fell as the first American
martyr in the Boston Massacre of 1770. It is also in the Puritan records
of New England where one may learn about Peter Salem, the Colored
soldier who avenged the death of the first seven American martyrs at
Lexington and Concord by slaying Major Pitcairn, the British officer who
in company with his men charged against the Colonists at Bunker Hill.
Among the hundreds of other men of color who took parts in those fierce
skirmishes were Salem Poor, reported at the Commander’s office for
extraordinary bravery at Bunker Hill, and “Black Prince” cited for
unexcelled gallantry at Newport. It is understood that among those who
received pensions at the close of the war were Cato Howe, A. Ames and T.
Coburn.</p>

<p>Few know that it was a Colored man, Jordan Freeman, who timely and
mortally received on his ready spear point the British officer, Major
Montgomery as he daringly leaped, followed by his soldiers, over the
walls of Griswold, an American fort. Later on in that same battle of
1781 the Colonists were over powered and compelled to surrender,
whereupon the American leader, Ledyard, courteously handed his sword to
the British officer in command. That unfair Englishman upon receiving
the sword immediately thrust it up to the hilt through the body of
Ledyard. A Colored soldier, Lambo Latham, who was standing near and saw
the dastardly act, made one mighty pantherlike leap and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span> loyally avenged
the death of his American commander by plunging his bayonet clear
through the body of that ungallant Britisher. For that act of fidelity
and patriotism, Lambo Latham received over thirty bayonet stabs from the
enemy before he stopped fighting and gave his last breath for America
and its white people who at that moment were denying their Colored
slaves the same sweet freedom for which they were fighting to get from
England.</p>

<p>Not only did “John Bull’s” subjects have to face human lions in the
forms of fighting Colored men, but they also had to feel the pains and
fear the death dealing blows of human tigeresses in the forms of Colored
women fighters. And all Americans who are truely proud of their country
and its real history should read and remember about one Molly Pitcher,
who after her husband had been killed in the battle of Monmouth, bravely
took his place at a cannon and nervely upheld America’s cause during the
remainder of that fierce and bloody conflict. Then there was the
undaunted and resourceful Deborah Gannet, who by assuming the name of
“Bob Shurtliff” entered the American army and went through more than one
year of actual battlefield fighting and camp life exposure. And during
her entire service she successfully kept her moral purity by cleverly
hiding from the officials and the soldiers the knowledge of her sex.
This in other words read her war record on a pension certificate granted
to her after her honorable discharge from the army. And there were
doubtless many other unrecognized but noble Negro women who entered
numerous conflicts and gave their last drop of blood and lives in order
that the white colonists might enjoy the freedom that their Colored
brothers and sisters then saw no signs of ever receiving.</p>

<h3>In the War of 1812
<br />
(1812)</h3>

<p>There are few people who know that one of the main causes of The War of
1812 was on account of the British forcibly taking and compelling three
Americans (two Negroes and one Caucasian) to sail under the English
flag. It was in that same war that a Colored soldier, Jefferys, on
seeing a body of American troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> retreating under heavy fires from the
enemy, dashed to their front, rallied them together, led their steps
back and repelled the British soldiers who were about to break through a
very important but weak point in General Jackson’s defense at Mobile.
That general not only noted that leadership rally but gave full credit
and praise where it was due. He also expressed gratefulness to the
soldier of color whose ideas first suggested the successful use of bales
of cotton for breastworks in fortifications. In the battles around New
Orleans he looked with soldierly pride upon the splendid fighting of his
black troops.</p>

<p>When American school children learn from their United States histories
that clean-cut and famous naval battle report, “We have met the enemy
and they are ours” ..., such histories do not also inform their readers
that the personal pronouns “we” and “ours” so prominent in Commodore
Perry’s above message includes the heroic deeds of Colored sailors as
well as white. So when in reciting these stirring words their
iron-charged bloods suddenly gallop through their veins; their chests
expand wide with national pride; their heads jerk erect with proud
fighting spirits and their eyes sparkle bright with slumbering fires,
such patriotic emotions have been unknowingly and involuntarily aroused
in true American youths because of the loss of Colored blood and lives
as well as of white in those lake battles. And among those
weather-beaten bronze “salts” were Jack Johnson (not our present
ex-champion heavyweight prize fighter of the world) and John Davis who
were both especially mentioned for distinguished service on the
schooner, “George Thompson.” That world known message of 1812 also
included many other Negro sailors who pitted their bravery and brawn
against the British “tars” in order to help Commodore Oliver Hazard
Perry to break the backbone of the War of 1812 by opening up a clear
passage on the Great Lakes. It was through that same newly made water
path that General William Henry Harrison (the hero of Tippicanoe, Log
Cabin and Hard Cider) and his seasoned famed Indian fighters were
conveyed in order to enter Canada where they completely defeated the
artful Proctor and slew the cunning Tecumseh in that savagely fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span>
battle of The Thames. Thus Colored fighters helped to end the foxy and
wolfish Proctor-Tecumseh partnership that had annoyed and tormented for
so long the American settlers on the Northern frontiers.</p>

<h3>In the Mexican War<br />
(1845-1847)</h3>

<p>If it were possible for General Santa Anna to bodily slip back to earth,
personally mingle amid and chat with those of his soldier friends who
are still living; it is more than likely that among the many things
talked over they would seriously mention the fact of having caught many
hasty glances of dark fighting faces under command of the American
Generals Taylor and Scott who kept the Mexicans on a constant
hop-step-and-a-jump around Vera Cruz, Buena Vista and other places in
that section.</p>

<p>On account of Negroes at that period being greatly removed from the
United States Army and State Militias, because of racial questions, it
is not likely that many Colored fighters had a chance to get busy in
that one and a half year backyard quarrel and fight. There was published
in a Western paper a few years ago an account of a Mexican War Colored
veteran known as Captain Jackson who died in Chicago, Ill., in 1894. And
in order to have received that military title, officially or
unofficially he surely must have used some brain power as well as much
brawn force in helping to establish America’s boundary line on the
Southern frontier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">M</span>ANY years before the Civil War there was organized among the Northern
white and Christian people, mostly Quakers, a secret society to help
runaway slaves to escape from the South into the free states and Canada.
This society, on account of its hidden, winding and rapid ways of
carrying its fleeing and hunted passengers into places of freedom and
safety, was known as the “Underground Railroad”.</p>

<p>“As early as 1786, there are evidences of an underground road. A letter
of George Washington, written in that year, speaks of a slave escaping
from Virginia to Philadelphia, and being there aided by a society of
Quakers formed for the purpose of assisting in liberating slaves. It was
not, however, until after the War of 1812, that escaped slaves began to
find their way by the underground roads in considerable numbers to
Canada.”</p>

<p>“From Maine to Kansas, all the northern States were dotted with the
underground stations and covered with a network of the underground
roads. It is estimated that between 1830 and 1860 over 9,000 slaves were
aided to escape by way of Philadelphia. During this same period in Ohio,
40,000 fugitives are said to have escaped by way of the underground
railroad.”</p>

<p>Reference (Work’s Negro Year Book; page 167, 1918-1919 edition).</p>

<p>Without doubt, among the greatest workers in that society and truest
white friends to the freedom seeking slaves were; Cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span>vin Fairbanks who
was arrested and kept for over fifteen years in Southern jails where he
was daily whipped until blood flowed from his back, just because he
helped human beings to get their freedom; Thomas Garrett who was jailed
and had to sell all his personal property and real estate to pay the
fines imposed upon him by the Southerners for doing the works of Jesus
Christ by aiding the weak and comforting the suffering. And when
penniless Thomas Garrett got out of jail he continued to help runaway
slaves to find their freedom; Samuel May whose Christianity helped
thousands of Colored people to enjoy the freedom due all human beings
instead of suffering yokes and chains belonging to dumb beasts of
burden; and Levi Coffin, who was recognized as the central electrical
force that so powerfully and silently drove on, and the chief consulting
engineer who so watchfully kept in motion the ever welloiled and
frictionless machinery of the underground railroad systems.</p>

<p>To the Colored boys and girls who desire to learn more about such
mysterious underground railroad trains, that with their nervy and plucky
passengers holding on with all their might, were constantly diving into
and running under rivers as well as climbing upon and rolling down
mountain sides without ever being wrecked or seldom losing a passenger,
the writer begs to offer the following suggestion:</p>

<p>Any evening when such boys and girls suddenly get a burning thirst to
visit the “movies” and drink in the red-blooded and heroic screen capers
of a Wm. S. Hart, a Pearl White or a Douglass Fairbanks; let those boys
and girls go to the nearest library instead, secure a copy of William
Still’s “Underground Railroad Records”, and return home with it. In its
stories they will find just as hair-raising adventures and exciting
escapes as are to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span> found in any of Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes detective
cases; between its leaves they will find the same kind of serious wit
and humor that smile up from a Walt Mason newspaper article; from cover
to cover they will find the same kind of heart-rending and
flesh-suffering word pictures that Longfellow and other authors have so
vividly painted in telling of the expulsions and wanderings of the
doomed Arcadians; but, last and most important of all they will find
every one of its pages to contain as true and valuable American history
as ever appeared in the writings of a Bancroft, a Fiske, a Higginson, a
Prescott or a Ridpath.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>F Colored men and women in the previous wars could become such
wonderful fighters and loyal Americans with no knowledge and little hope
of ever receiving freedom from their unnumbered slave sufferings and
sacrifices; then, how much braver and more patriotic would they be when
fighting with a new hope and full knowledge that their future freedom
depended upon the success of the side on which they were fighting? It is
needless to say that out of the more than one hundred forty thousand
Colored people who took active parts in the Civil War, there were
countless numbers of gallant and self-sacrificing deeds performed by
them that were only seen and noted by God. And those acts of valor and
heroism that were witnessed and recorded here on earth by mankind are so
numerous that space herein will not allow but the mention of a very few.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Captain Andre Cailloux was one of the bravest soldiers to fall in the
Union charge on Fort Hudson. It is said that his Company charged that
fort six times looking point-blank into the red-flaming, fire-spitting,
bullet-biting and smoke-breathing mouths of the enemy’s cannons, with a
heavy loss among his men in each charge. Feeling sure he was going to
his certain death, yet never flynching, a Colored soldier, Anselmas
Plancianocis, who was a color sergeant, uttered the following words to
his commander before departing to his post of duty within gun range and
full view to the enemy; “Colonel, I will bring back these colors in
honor, or report to God the reason why.” He never brought back the
colors. At another time during the noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> battle at Fort Wagner, it was
William Carney who upon seeing the colors about to trail on the ground
as they slipped from the relaxing grasp of a dying comrade, quickly
leaped to his side grabbed the flag staff and planted it on the
breastworks. When he in turn was severely wounded and carried to the
rear, he had just strength and breath enough to whisper, “Boys, the Old
flag never touched the ground.” Both artists and poets have often come
forth to paint and sing of the fierce fighting and brave stand made by
that famous 54th Massachusetts Colored Regiment and its fearless and
beloved white commander, Col. Robert Gould Shaw. He fell in the thickest
of the battle surrounded by hundreds of his wounded and dying Colored
troops whom he had watched over as a loving father and always led as a
fighting officer. Although Col. Shaw and his men were greatly
outnumbered by the enemy who repulsed their attack at Fort Wagner, the
Colored soldiers, who had marched continually a day and a night without
stopping and then pitched right into fighting without rest or food,
proved to both the North and South that they were among the bravest of
brave soldiers.</p>

<p>Civil War veterans now living, and when meeting each other usually
become so excited when tongue fighting their battles over again that
they forget for the time being all about their rheumatics and, throw
away their canes as they hop about trying to imitate their former
military actions in battles. Those who were there take delight in
telling how Gen. Fitzhugh Lee and his prancing Old Dominion well trained
white soldiers met their “Waterloo” in Fort Powhatan at the hands of the
belittled and untrained slave troops. It was at Fort Harrison in
Virginia that the Southerners on seeing Negro troops charging on the
fort, taunted them with, “Come on darkies, we want your muskets.” Eye
witnesses say that the so-called “darkies” being so used to obeying
orders really did take the guns to the fort, but several hours
afterwards when the smoke had cleared away it was seen that those Rebels
who had remained to accept the muskets had received the bayonet ends
through their bodies instead of the trigger ends into their hands. Gen.
B. F. Butler’s records show that his ten regiments of ex-slave soldiers
brought victory and fame all along their fighting lines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<p>Aside from the chief motive to help free themselves, without doubt one
of the main things that spurred the Negro men to fight so valiantly was
their constant memory of Fort Pillow. At that fort were stationed 292
Northern white soldiers and 262 Colored troops, all under the command of
Major L. F. Booth. On the twelfth of April 1864 that place was
surrounded by a much larger Confederate force under Generals Chalmers
and Forest and ordered to surrender. Upon the fort refusing to do so,
the Rebels closed in with their usual battle cry, “No Quarter”. And then
as they broke in the fort and overpowered the handful of Union men,
there began a scene of unmentioned butchering and slaughtering of
Northern white soldiers and Colored ex-slave men, women and children
that far surpassed in horribleness the massacre of Custer and his
faithful little band by the Sioux chief, Sitting Bull and his merciless
Indian warriors. So after that whenever Colored men entered battles
their answer to the Rebel’s “No Quarter” was a challenge “Remember Fort
Pillow,” and times too numerous to mention did Negro soldiers fully
avenge that awful massacre of their comrades on that April day in Fort
Pillow.</p>

<p>By reading the battlefield records of Gen. Thomas at Miliken’s Bend;
Gen. Morgan at Nashville; Gen. Blount at Henry Springs; Gen. Smith at
Petersburg; Generals S. C. Armstrong, B. F. Butler and O. O. Howard at
other vital places, as well as the fighting records made in Virginia at
Wilson Wharf, Deep Bottom, Fair Oaks, Hatchers Run and Farmville; full
proofs can be found regarding the Colored soldiers’ supreme brave fights
made for a twofold purpose&mdash;the saving of the Union and the freedom of
themselves.</p>

<p>In summing up this part of this very important topic, the writer can
think of no better way of strengthening the truth of foregoing
assertions relative to Negro battlefield valour and loyalty in the Civil
War than by quoting the following: “When the battle test came these
regiments justified the hopes entertained by their sanguine friends.”
This just and high tribute was paid to Colored Civil War fighters by
Comrade John McElroy, a white editor of Washington, D.C., in the
editorial cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span>respondence of his National Tribune published April 7,
1921. He had written about General Rufus Saxton of Massachusetts taking
military command of St. Helena Island, S. C. and forming the thousands
of idle Negro men into regiments during the early stages of the Civil
War.</p>

<h3>On the Sea</h3>

<p>In the month of June, 1861, the Union schooner, “S. J. Waring” was
captured by the Confederate privateer, “Jeff Davis”. All the crew of the
schooner, with the exception of a Colored man, William Tillman and two
white men, were taken from the ship and replaced by Rebel sailors. At an
opportune moment Tillman killed the Rebel captain and mate, drove all
the other Rebels at the point of a gun below deck and took full charge
of the ship. After ploughing through a terrific storm, during which time
the Rebel sailors were brought up and forced to help man the wave-tossed
ship, the Colored sailor safely guided the recaptured “S. J. Waring”
into the harbor of New York. For that nervy and patriotic act he
received from the Federal Government prize money amounting to six
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>It was through the cool-headedness, gamesness and shrewd planning of
Robert Small, a man of color, that the Confederate gunboat, “The
Planter” was stolen out of Charleston Harbor, running the gauntlet of
the Rebel’s watchful forts and barking cannons and safely delivered into
the hands of a Northern squadron. In payment for this naval strategy
Robert Small was made captain of the gunboat he captured and during his
service continued to show marked fearlessness as a fighting sailor and
unusual executive ability as a commanding officer.</p>

<p>When the Civil War was finally ended by General Ulysses S. Grant of the
Union Army compelling General Robert E. Lee of the Rebel Army to
surrender at Appomattox Court House, Va., on April 9, 1865, the Colored
soldiers and sailors laid aside their warfare weapons with proud and
thankful feelings that they had been given such great chances to help
fight for and secure their own freedom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE slaves who went into the battles of the Civil War came up to all the
standards of loyalty and bravery that had been set for them as fighting
soldiers. But it was left to the millions of Colored men who staid on
the plantations during the war to come up to and go far beyond the
standards of moral self-control and human just treatment set by their
owners. The Colored men who were in the war were really enjoying a
temporary freedom while they were fighting for a permanent freedom. But
it was quite different with the shackled men who staid on the
plantations during the war. They were then slaves not only one way but
in three ways. First, they were still slaves to their owners as they
were yet under their control; secondly, they were slaves to themselves
inasmuch as they were their own bosses and overseers to plant, cultivate
and reap the crops in the absence of the white men; thirdly and most
important of all, they were slaves to the trust and honor under which
they had been left with the care and protection of the white women and
children on the plantations. And no records in history have been found
to show where those thousands of white wives, daughters, mothers and
sisters made complaints to their returned husbands, sons, fathers and
brothers about having forced upon them insulting and raping attentions
from those millions of slave men under whose whole care those white
women had been freely left and safely kept during the Civil War.</p>

<p>If those Colored men had wanted to copy the spiteful, revengeful and
immoral actions of most of their white owners, they could easily have
mistreated or destroyed all of those helpless white women and children
in revenge for the two hundred and forty-four years of unspeakable
crimes committed against their Colored womanhood by the Southern white
slave owners and overseers. Or the slaves could have run away, joined
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span> Union Army in a mass and left alone those destitute white women and
children to starve on the untilled plantations. But those men of the
Negro race, not then three hundred years from the underbrush of Africa,
had under their dark skins too much inborn manhood and brotherhood
qualities to stoop down to such beastily acts. They naturally grasped
that grand and big opportunity to show to the Southern white people and
the rest of the watchful world (that helplessly looked on in silence but
with pitiful and admiring glances) that they had in their characters and
dispositions and knew when and how to use them, the sterling principles
of open-fairness, loyal friendliness, tender feelings, human
considerations, moral self-control and Christlike mercy.</p>

<p>It is undeniably true that as early as 1860 there were in the United
States over five hundred eighty-eight thousand Mulattoes. (Ref. Work’s
Negro Year Book, page 432, 1918-1919 edition). Among that large number
many thousands were beautiful and innocent girls who were either
retained as their white owners’ immoral mistresses on Southern
plantations or sold hither and thither from the Potomac River to the
Gulf of Mexico to be forced into shameful and degraded lives a
thousand-fold more friendless, unhappy and unprotected than Longfellow’s
wandering Evangeline.</p>

<p>As the Civil War did not begin until 1861, it is readily seen that those
one half million and more Mulattoes were not the results of slave men
forcing immoral attentions upon the white women and girls left under
their personal cares during the four years of the Civil War. But those
half-Colored, half white people were the undeniable results of the
brutal rapings of white plantation owners and overseers upon their
helpless and unprotected black slave women for over two hundred years.
So is it strange that fair and pure minded white people throughout the
world, knowing and seeing all around them today the increased results of
those first beastily actions by immoral members of their own race,
listen without interest but with shame and impatience whenever, through
sheer politeness, they are compelled to remain as audiences before
certain classes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> Southern men who for centuries (including today)
have been talking through mouth and press about keeping their Southern
white blood untainted and unstained? Colored boys and girls, therefore,
should not become down-hearted and discouraged when they read in
newspapers or hear from platforms such Southern white men writing or
making such “Jekel-Hyde” talks; because close-observing, sound-reasoning
and fair-judging white people in the South, in the North and throughout
the world fully understand the whole situation and do not in the least
take such Southern false utterances seriously. In fact they usually
cannot keep from laughing at the funny side of the whole thing and say
among themselves, “How absurd.”</p>

<p>No one but God knows the number of deceived Southern white married women
who during slavery days secretly worried themselves sick, slowly pined
away and silently died of broken hearts in their richly furnished
colonial mansions, because of the ever haunting, taunting and stinging
knowledge that their unfaithful, disloyal and immoral husbands as well
as being the fathers of their white wives’ children were also the
fathers of their slave mistresses’ Mulatto offsprings. So is it
surprising that clean-living, clean-thinking and justice-loving white
people always exchange knowing winks with their friends and hurriedly
put handkerchiefs up to their mouths in order to hide disgusted features
and weary yawns whenever they find themselves in places where they have
to listen to certain classes of Southern white men who for centuries
(including today) have been boasting from platform and press about their
unsurpassed and unexcelled fidelity and chivalry to their Southern white
womanhood? Instead of losing their ambitions and hopes when hearing and
reading such blaspheming words against their race and progress, Colored
boys and girls should take on new hope and redouble their efforts in
striving to become even more devout Christians, higher learned students,
better skilled industrial workers and fuller law-abiding citizens. In
reference to the inferiority of their colors, Colored youths should
remember that the prettiest thing in the world (the rainbow) is Colored,
and yet, no one is able to resist the fascinations of its archful beauty
or forget the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> consolations of its floodless promise, just because
Nature with splashing rain drops and flashing sun rays oft ribbons the
sky with rainbow hues.</p>

<p>No one but God knows the number of black slave women who moaned their
heart strings loose and died of broken spirits either in their
one-roomed log cabins or out in fence-cornered fields, because of the
ever torturing knowledge that the virtues and womanhoods of themselves
and the chaste maidenhoods of their immatured and innocent daughters had
been repeatedly and forcibly taken or sold by their white owners and
overseers. Yet, not one of those white rapists was lynched, tortured and
burned at the stake by Negroes, not even at the close of the Civil War
when there were thousands of ex-slave holders living in some Southern
districts where the Colored people outnumbered the white people five to
one. And surely, after gallantly fighting through the thickest and
hottest battles of the war, it was not fear nor cowardice that held
those Colored men from avenging the unprintable immoral wrongs forcibly
done for over two hundred years to their unprotected and helpless
Colored women. But, it was the living up to and the carrying out of a
certain high civic principle of their African tribal laws that they had
inherited and which prevented the ex-slaves from striking such a
revengeful blow upon the Southern whites. For among savage tribes in
Africa the universal punishment for raping was certain death; different
tribes having different methods of dealing out that penalty. But that
punishment was never dealt out by a mob. Those tribes so respected and
obeyed the laws under which they lived and were governed that as savage
as they appeared to be, they always had enough self-control over their
tempers and passions to leave the captures, trials, convictions and
executions of such offenders to be carried out by their chiefs and their
assistants who had been put in their offices for such purposes. And
since America had made laws and appointed officers who should have
caught, tried, convicted and punished those Southern white men who raped
enough black women to cause the birth of over a half million Mulattoes,
the ex-slave men felt that even if those laws had not been enforced by
people who had been selected to do so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span> it was not their rights to take
the laws into their own hands by forming themselves into lynching mobs.
They felt that just as raping of either black or white women is a most
damnable crime; so is lynching either by black or white mobs a most
hellish sin. In making comparisons between the ancient laws of Nippur
and the modern laws of the United States, relative to slaves, the
world-famed journalist, Arthur Brisbane, in the June 22, 1920 issue of
the New York American, under the title, “Today”, wrote in part as
follows:</p>

<p>“Five thousand years ago some laws were better than those of our day.</p>

<p>“For instance, in those ancient laws, if a slave woman had a child, the
father being her owner, the mother and the child were set free. In
magnificent America, in Lincoln’s day, thousands of slave children, with
slave owners for fathers, were sold in the public markets.”</p>

<p>Now, not for one moment do intelligent and law-abiding Colored citizens
uphold or make excuses for the brutish crimes committed by the
degenerate members (and there are many) of their own race. For they
fully realize that it means a faster and higher progress of all their
people to have Colored criminals punished to the fullest extent of the
law, after they have been given the same fair trials, convictions and
sentences that are handed out to the thousands of white criminals who
commit the same kind of crimes. And just as Colored degenerates are
disgusting and shameful to up-right living white people, so are white
degenerates disgusting and shameful to up-right living Colored people.
Thus the broad-minded and law-abiding Colored and white citizens now
mutually know that it is for the greater advancement of both races and a
closer brotherhood combining of all Americans for them to see to it, as
far as possible, that all criminals be rightly protected when arrested,
given fair trials, safely guarded after sentenced and fully punished in
a confinement where they cannot further morally lower themselves nor
longer dilute the purity of human society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span></p>

<p>And in thus far carrying out their Christian duties for the elevation of
humanity, good Colored and white people are contented in knowing that
for those criminals of both races who are shrewd enough to escape the
detection and punishment of earthly laws, there is a Heavenly law that
never fails to punish them at the proper time. And even while on their
death beds those evil doers are twisting and turning in mental and
bodily sufferings, they will not on account of their torturing pains be
able to truthfully and peacefully chant such consoling lines that are
found in Tennyson’s poem “Crossing The Bar”, nor will their names be
written in that “Book of Gold” where it is said Abou Ben Adhem had his
name inscribed above all of those who loved the Lord, because he (Abou
Ben Adhem) loved all his fellowmen.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">“T</span>HE only American music”. This is the terse, sincere and high comment
made quite a number of years ago by Edward Everett Hale, author of “A
Man Without a Country”, in relation to the rightful recognition and
value of the American Negro melodies sung on the Southern plantations
during slavery. Since then, well-read, well-bred and music loving people
of both races have come to fully recognize, acknowledge and appreciate
the truthfulness of the above compliment.</p>

<p>For many years after their freedom great number of ex-slaves harbored
bitter dislikes toward these songs because they so clearly and painfully
reminded them of their past ill-treatment and sufferings during slave
days. Most of their children caught this feeling direct from their
parents or indirectly through their own vivid imaginations formed from
what they had heard about slavery. But quick and deep understanding
people of both races soon found in these crude tuneful words something
far more interesting and touching than mere memories of slavery sins and
sufferings&mdash;they saw and felt in such weird and original<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span> chants the
most beautiful and truest life pictures of the true soul that it is
possible for human being to paint with colorful and verbal expressions
of tear moistened sorrows and smile dried joys. Thus music lovers and
masters began at once to value this music as among the most precious
finds to be added to their treasuries of folk-lore songs.</p>

<p>World recognized Negro music transposers and composers are today taking
these rough, crude and half-savage chants and, without destroying their
originalities of construction or pureness of quality, lifting them from
the lowest depths of ignorant fun-making burlesquers to the highest
level of intelligent and serious-minded music admirers. And throughout
the musical world today celebrated chorus leaders, conductors, etc., of
both races in giving even operatic recitals indicate by their programs
rendered that they consider no first-class recital complete unless one
or more of its numbers are expressions of Negro folk-lore music as
Burleigh, Dett, Diton, Work and others have so classically elevated
them. These broad-minded and just manifestations are gradually causing
the general public to become more interested in, give more serious
thought to, and show more appreciation of the true dignity and value of
these melodies. They are also rapidly educating the American Colored
people as a mass not to hate and cast aside but to love and preserve
this music as a race pride heritage so costly purchased and handed down
by their fore-parents and as one of the most valuable and rare features
of American history.</p>

<p>Among the foremost composers, singers and lecturers in the Negro race
who are giving tremendous aid and are largely responsible for the
development of the above favorable sentiments are Cleveland G. Allen,
New York, N. Y., Harry Burleigh, New York, N. Y., R. Nathaniel Dett,
Hampton, Va., Carl Ditson, Phila., Pa., E. Azalia Hackley, Detroit,

</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>N taking a swift but careful glance back to that historical and
red-letter year of 1863, it will be noted that there was born at that
time into these United States a form of whole liberty that had been
fathered and nourished by the world-beloved Abraham Lincoln. Before the
above date this country had existed under only a one-sided liberty that
had been won from the English for the white Americans by the illustrious
George Washington. But it was left for Abraham Lincoln to win for the
United States a two-sided liberty by cutting the chains of slavery from
the wrists and ankles of the black Americans and also refreeing the
white Americans by unchaining from their souls the slave-holding
temptations they had become too weak-minded to resist and too selfish to
give up of their own accord.</p>

<p>As soon as the Colored people had passed out from the sufferings of
slavery, they were at once compelled as free, but ignorant, homeless and
penniless, people to begin their upward struggles and progress through a
reign of terror. This reign of terror was caused by the brutal treatment
and murdering of thousands of innocent Colored people and the
destruction of their properties by an uneducated, uncivilized and
unchristianized element of Southern white people who were known as
“Night Riders”, “Ku Klux Klan”, etc., of whom the best minded white
people even in the South were ashamed.</p>

<p>But the sturdy and hopeful Colored people came through that awful ordeal
as they had come through slavery, with increasing determination and
greater efforts to push forward and upward to the best and highest
things in life. However, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span> only their unfaltering trust in God
that gave them enough hopeful vision in the future; it was only their
gratitude to and appreciation of their Northern and Southern white
aiding friends that retained them enough patience and faith in mankind;
it was only their keenness to see the funny side of life’s happenings
that enabled them to laugh and keep cheerful; it was only their ability
and willingness to do any and all kinds of hard work that enabled them
to sleep through the whole nights with peaceful minds; and it was only
their great big healthy (everlasting-non-fasting) appetites that gave
them enough vitality, stamina, physical strength and energy-plus to pass
through those years of body sufferings and spirit crushings and safely
reach their present stages of upward progress and onward success.</p>

<p>Thus the Negro race has proven that just as a red-blooded,
self-confident, self-reliant and resourceful individual cannot rest with
a peaceful and happy mind as long as staying in the easygoing,
smoothly-worn and narrow “rut” of a least-resistance, non-progressive
position, but fearlessly steps out with a determined mind, hopeful heart
and unbounded enthusiasm to face and overcome the ups-and-down of this
rough-and-ready world that finally yields up to that individual his or
her well-earned and genuine success; so will a race of people of similar
qualities and aspirations be restless until it wades and crawls out of a
miry and stagnant pool of ignorance and poverty and enters a channel of
freshly flowing active thoughts where it can freely swim abreast in fair
competition with other races in order to reach those distant ports of
Christian service, citizenship usefulness, financial independence, self
culture and human helpfulness.</p>

<p>While the Negro race in the United States succeeded in swimming into
that channel in 1861, it has never been allowed, like other races
therein, to use either a rapid-lunging and noisy over-head double-arm
stroke or a swift-gliding and noiseless under-water crawl-stroke; but,
has been compelled to paddle along using a one-arm bull-frog stroke,
having one leg and arm tied together with strings of race
discriminations, the entire racing course clogged with floating debris
of public decayed sentiments and a plaited cord of race
jealousy-envy-spite tied<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> to the big toe of the free leg that has been
roughly and constantly yanked back throughout the swim. With all that
prejudiced and unsportsmanlike handicap, the American Colored people
have increased their ownership of homes from twelve thousand in 1866 to
six hundred thousand in 1919; they owned in 1910 over two hundred
thousand farms that with other real estate holdings comprised twenty-one
million acres of land; in 1866 they ran a little over two thousand
business enterprises and in 1919 they had increased that number to fifty
thousand business concerns doing a volume of business amounting to about
one billion two hundred million dollars; in 1919 there were annually
being spent for their education fifteen million dollars; starting out in
1866 with seven hundred churches they kept on building and buying Houses
of God until in 1919 they owned forty-three thousand such buildings
valued at more than eighty-four million dollars; and while the American
Colored people in 1866 were worth twenty million dollars, they continued
to earn and save money until in 1919 they had accumulated a wealth of
one billion one hundred million dollars. (above figures extracted from
Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, pgs. 1-2-345.)</p>

<p>There are located in over 25 States throughout the Union nearly a
hundred towns and villages that are inhabited and governed wholly by
Colored people. The largest of these settlements is described below.</p>

<h3>BOLEY, OKLAHOMA</h3>

<p>Boley, Oklahoma, was founded on September 22, 1904 by two Colored men,
T. M. Haynes and James Barnett, and since then has enjoyed the greatest
growth of any exclusive Negro community in the United States. There is a
population of 2,500 in the city and 1,200 in the adjoining district.
There are no white people living in the city and all of the farms within
a distance of 8 to 10 miles are owned, with but few exceptions, by
Colored farmers who possess as much as 900 acres individually. Farming
is the chief industry of the community and about 90 per cent of the
population own modern homes, many of them costing $5,000 and more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span></p>

<p>All of the city offices, telephone exchange, telegraph office, depot
agency, Post Office (only Third Class one in the world totally run by
Negroes) are conducted by Colored people. All the business
establishments and industries, that are of nearly every kind including
several cotton gins are owned and carried on by Negro business men and
women, one merchant being worth $100,000.00. The city has its own paved
streets, electric light plant, ice plant, water system, and modern city
High School costing $20,000, two private newspapers and a private Bank.</p>

<p>Some of the important buildings and institutions in the city are the
State School of the C. M. E. Church that has a modern three-story
$20,000 building; the Masonic three-story Temple; The Widow and Orphan
Home of the U. B. F. Grand Lodge; the $150,000 State Tubercular
Sanitarium for Negroes; and seven churches with creditable buildings.
Prospects are so promising that the community is expecting to have oil
wells within the next two or three years.</p>

<p>This is not a bad record for such a handicapped life swimmer as the
Negro Race is compelled to be in the United States and certainly proves
that, when it comes to keeping a lead-weighted body above the water
surface and at the same time make progress up a rough stream against a
strong down-flowing prejudiced current, the Negro, if he really is a
fifth cousin to the foolish, noisy, frolicsome and “Call Of The Wild”
goose family, he is also a first cousin to the sensible, industrious,
frugal, quiet, dignified and home-loving swan family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IN_CONGRESS" id="IN_CONGRESS"></a>IN CONGRESS</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>T is a most remarkable fact that only seven years after the
emancipation of his race, Hiram R. Revels, a Colored man, entered the
United States Congress as a senator from Mississippi. But it becomes a
two-fold remarkable and interesting fact when one learns that the
Congressional seat taken by Revels was the chair made vacant by
Jefferson Davis who left Congress and the Union side to join the
Confederacy where he later became its president and leader to keep
Negroes in slavery. That explains the question so many people have asked
why Revels only served one year (1870-1871) in the Senate. He was
elected to serve the last year that Jeff Davis had left unfinished in
his term when he went over to the Rebel forces. B. K. Bruce, also from
Mississippi, served a full term of six years in the Senate. So far those
two have been the only Colored men to be seated and serve in the U. S.
Senate. In 1872, P. B. S. Pinchback, a Colored man, was elected to the
U. S. Senate, but the right of the Legislature to legally elect a
senator was challenged. The contention was urged that the Legislature
itself was not legally elected. The contest lasted four years and ended
with seven Republican Senators voting with the Democrats to deny him the
seat. He was later given four years salary as a senator. During the
period of Reconstruction right after the Civil War this same Colored man
was elected and served as Lieutenant-Governor of Louisiana and once
while the Governor, W. P. Kellogg was absent from the State for a brief
period, Lt. Gov. P. B. S. Pinchback acted as Governor of Louisiana.</p>

<p>J. R. Lynch was elected from Mississippi to the U. S. House of
Representatives. Other Colored men who have been members in the House
were as follows: Louisiana sent J. H. Menard and C. E. Nash; Georgia
sent J. T. Long; Alabama sent B. S. Turner, J. T. Rapier, and J.
Harlson; Virginia sent J. M. Langston; Florida sent J. T. Walls; South
Carolina took the lead in numbers by sending R. B. Elliott, R. C.
DeLarge, R. H. Cain, A. J. Ransier, Robert Small, T. E. Miller, G. W.
Murray, and J. H. Rainey who by being elected five times exceeded any
other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span> Negro in length of service (ten years) in the House. But it was
left for North Carolina to “Tar Heel” in the rear of that Congressional
noble march by sending the latest Colored member to Congress in the
person of the late George H. White, who as a Representative had been
proceeded from that same state in the same branch of the U. S.
Legislature by J. Hyman, J. E. O’Harra and H. P. Cheatham. (extracts
from Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, pg. 207.)</p>

<h3>In The U. S. Diplomatic Service</h3>

<p>While a U. S. Senator or Representative acts in the Legislature at
Washington, D.C. as spokesman for a few thousand people living in a
certain section of the state that elects him; a Minister or Consul to
foreign countries acts as a spokesman for all the millions of American
citizens living in all the United States of America. Thus, while the
Colored Congressman held a very honorable and influential federal
position; the Colored man who had served either as a minister or consul
to foreign lands was the one who really shouldered the highest and most
responsible Government position ever accorded to an American Colored
person.</p>

<p>Some of those of the Race who have served in this last named branch of
the Government are: A. H. Grimke, Minister to San Domingo, E. D.
Bassett, Frederick Douglas, J. S. Durham, S. A. Furness, and L. W.
Livingston, Ministers and Consuls to Haiti; T. M. Chester, Dr. J. R.
Grossland, J. L. Johnson and E. W. Lyons, Consul and Ministers to
Liberia; Jas. Weldon Johnson, Consul to Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, to
Corinto, Nicaragua and to the Azores; J. C. Carter, and M. Wistar Gibbs,
Consuls to Madagascar; Wm. H. Hunt and W. A. Jackson, Consuls to France;
R. T. Greener, Consul to Vladivostok; W. J. Yerb, Consul to Dakar, West
Africa. (some of above extracts from Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919
edition, pg. 208).</p>

important Federal positions are Chas. W. Anderson, Collector of Internal

<h3>In State Legislatures</h3>

<p>Upon being elected in 1866 to the Massachusetts House of
Representatives, C. L. Mitchell and E. G. Walker, became the first
Colored men to serve in any state legislature in America. Since that
time up to the present day nearly a thousand men of the Race have served
as Representatives in different state legislatures. Some of those having
been elected within the past few years as members of state congressional
bodies are as follows:</p>

<p>W. G. Alexander, New Jersey; J. C. Asbury, H. W. Bass and A. F. Stevens,
Pennsylvania; J. A. Brown, H. E. Davis and H. C. Smith, Ohio; J. C.
Coleman, H. J. Copehart, J. M. Ellis, E. H. Harper, T. G. Nutter, C.
Payne and H. H. Railey, West Virginia; W. R. Douglass, A. H. Roberts and
S. B. Turner, and Robt. R. Jackson, Illinois; J. C. Hawkins, New York;
E. A. Johnson, N. Y.; W. M. Moore, Missouri; F. M. Roberts, California
and J. M. Ryan, District of Columbia.</p>

<h3>In City Government</h3>

<p>The following names are those of a few of the many Colored politicians
scattered throughout the country who are earnestly and intelligently
helping their city governments to direct old and make new laws for the
welfare of all races in their represented districts:</p>

<p>Councilman J. A. Adams, Annapolis, Md.; Alderman L. B. Anderson,
Chicago, Ill.; Councilman J. Brown, Urbana, Ohio; Councilman V.
Chambliss, Mounds, Ill.; Councilman R. A. Cooper, Philadelphia;
ex-Alderman Oscar De Priest, Chicago, Ill.; Councilmen T. W. Fleming,
Cleveland, Ohio, S. A. Furniss, Indianapolis, Ind., W. M. Fitzgerald,
Baltimore, Md.; Alderman, G. W. Harris, and Assemblyman J. C. Hawkins,
New York City, N. Y.; Alderman J. H. Hopkins, Wilmington, Del.; Alderman
H. R. Jackson, Chicago, Ill.; Councilman Robt. R. Jackson, Chicago,
Ill.; Assemblyman E. A. Johnson, New York City, N. Y.; Councilman W. T.
McQuinn, Baltimore, Md.; C. Scott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span> Worcester, Mass, and H. St. Clair,
Cambridge, Md.; Alderman T. E. Stevens, Cleveland, Tenn.; Councilmen H.
Ward, Nicholasville, Ky. and F. F. Wright, Boston, Mass.; Committeeman
E. H. Wright, Chicago, Ill. (some of the above names are extracts from
Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, page 54.) Milton White and
Amos Scott are very prominent in Phila., Pa. politics as well as
unusually successful businessmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IN_THE_SPANISH-AMERICAN_WAR" id="IN_THE_SPANISH-AMERICAN_WAR"></a>IN THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>HENEVER Colored people hear mentioned the Spanish-American War, their
first thoughts naturally dig up proud memories of the 9th and 10th
Colored Cavalries, the 24th and 25th Colored Regiments, The 8th
Illinois, Ohio Battalion and others bravely facing raining shot and
shell pouring down from the hill tops of El Caney and San Juan. And ever
will it go down in history that they were members of the celebrated 10th
Colored Cavalry who while fighting on San Juan Hill sprang to the timely
rescue of the late Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and his famous Rough
Riders and saved them from certain and horrible deaths at the hands of
the merciless Spaniards.</p>

<p>But why here go further into details regarding the conduct of Colored
men in that war when the official reports of such capable warriors and
experienced military judges as Major-Generals W. R. Shafter, J. F. Kent,
H. W. Lawton, Joseph Wheeler, Colonel (now General) Leonard Wood and
other high commanding officers give rightful credit and praise to the
Colored soldiers who displayed such remarkable patriotism and heroism in
that short and fierce “There’ll be a Hot Time in the Old Town To-night”
war? (This quotation is the title of a very popular tune sung during
this war by the American soldiers and civilians.)</p>

<p>When Hobson made his dare-devil and world-famed sea trip through a
gauntlet of Spanish frowning guns, there were more than twenty-five
Colored sailors with him who then shared all of his dangers and later a
little of his fame. Another most important naval action centered around
a Colored sailor, John C. Jordan, Chief Gunner’s Mate, who on May 1,
1898 during the battle of Manilla fired the first shot from the crusier,
“Olympia,” flag ship of the late Admiral Dewey. That was the shot that
opened the first decisive battle of the Spanish-American War as well as
starting the destruction of the modern Spanish Armada. It is surely in
place to mention here that Jordan entered the Navy as a third-class
apprentice and was honorably retired<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> as a Chief Petty Officer after
spending thirty of his best years in the Navy working and waiting for
“Uncle Sammy” to give him his just recognition and “Aunt Liberty” to
give him a fuller caress of citizenship privileges.</p>

<h3>In the Massacre at Carrizal</h3>

<p>Another backyard quarrel and fight occured 1916 between the United
States and Mexico. The famous 10th Colored Cavalry, 24th and 25th
Colored Infantries were sent with Chicago National Guards to help watch
the American border. On the morning of June 21, 1916, two divisions of
the 10th Cavalry, Companies C and K, wished to pass through Carrizal to
reach Villa Alunado. They were invited to come nearer for a friendly
parley with the Mexicans. As the American soldiers drew closer to the
place many of the Mexicans slyly, slowly and seemingly unconcerned
quietly fell back, spread out and in Indian style rapidly formed a
circle around the little band of unsuspecting Americans before they had
really noticed what had been done. At an unseen given signal the Colored
troops were suddenly attacked. They were outnumbered eight to one and in
the engagement lost fifteen killed, had nine wounded and twenty-three
captured, who received much inhuman treatment from the hands of their
captors. Among the many brave acts of heroism during the day’s fighting
was the one of Peter Bagstaff, a trooper of the 10th Cavalry, who in the
very face of the Mexicans’ hailing shots staid by the side of his
mortally wounded Lieut. H. F. Adair, giving that officer physical aid
until death ended his sufferings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">R</span>EGARDLESS of their two hundred and ninety-eight years of unstained and
unquestioned loyalty and patriotism in America, Colored people at the
time the United States was about to enter the World War, were made to
feel that they were not needed nor wanted in the conflict. And on many
occasions they were even told that the World War was not their affair
but was a “white man’s war.” Here is again shown where an inherited
African instinct&mdash;that of usually being able to sense some big future
happening&mdash;enabled the American Colored people to see far enough into
the distance to fully realize that white people who made such remarks
were sadly mistaken. Colored people then knew as all other people later
found out that they were as much concerned and needed in that world
conflict as any and all other races of people who took part in it.</p>

<p>But not until America was fearfully startled and sensibly awakened by
the rapid and persistent progress of the Germans into France did this
country reluctantly consent to give the Colored soldiers a half-fair
chance and part in the war. And even then their acceptances had more the
resemblances of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> probationary trials of total strangers rather than
the glad welcomings of life-long and never-failing friends. In other
words, figuratively speaking, it was in the highly tempered crucibles of
the World War’s whitehot furnaces of universal conflict that Negro
Americanism was put through a retesting process, in order to determine
the actual purity of its material and abstract composition. As to the
outcome of that unnecessary and unjust retesting process, let the reader
(like a minutely trained chemist) sum up in accurate notations the final
results, but only after carefully weighing and reweighing the following
analysis in the ever-balanced scales of impartiality.</p>

<p>Henry Johnson, Albany, N. Y. and Needham Roberts, of Trenton, N. J. were
the first two Americans soldiers, Colored or white, who were honored by
the French Government with the much coveted Croix de Guerre. These men
were privates in the 369th Infantry, formerly the distinguished
Fifteenth New York National Guard Regiment, that had been brigaded with
French troops. It was during the loneliest and latest hours of a night
in May, 1918 while Johnson and Roberts were on guard duty at an outpost
on the Front near the German lines that they were suddenly surrounded
and attacked by a raiding party of a score of German soldiers. Although
the two colored boys used their firearms with quickness and deadly aim
to keep the enemy off, the superior number of Germans, wounding Johnson
three times and Roberts twice, closed in on them in a hand-to-hand death
struggle. They soon had Roberts on the ground helpless, one German at
his head and another at his feet. Johnson noticing the sad plight of his
loyal friend, leaped forward like a wild cat at bay and with one mighty
downward blow of his bolo knife split wide open the head of the enemy
who was strangling Roberts. Then with a crouching pantherlike spring
Johnson made a terrific sweep with his trusty knife that completely
opened the stomach of the German at Roberts’ feet. Although on the
ground covered with blood and gore, Roberts upon thus being released
immediately began to hurl hand grenades among the enemy with telling
effect. As the foe, with whose stomach Johnson’s bolo knife had made
such a deep and lasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span> acquaintance, was the leader of the raiding
party, the then thoroughly frightened Germans suddenly lost their nerve,
dropped their weapons, picked up their helpless ones and made a hasty
retreat. Some of the Germans had been killed and many of the party
received such wounds and indelible marks that throughout their future
lives they will always be reminded that American Colored is a guaranteed
fast dye (slow die) that does not run.</p>

<p>Among the three hundred thousand and more Colored soldiers who served in
the United States Army during the World War, twenty thousand were
already prepared and in fighting trim when America declared war against
Germany. Those twenty thousand men were divided into the First Separate
Battalion of the District of Columbia; Company G, Tennessee National
Guards; First Separate Companies of Maryland and Connecticut; Company L,
National Guards of Massachusetts; Ninth Battalion of Ohio; 15th New York
National Guard; Eighth Illinois Regiment; 9th and 10th Cavalries; 24th
and 25th Infantries. After spending the necessary time in undergoing the
proper government training, 639 Colored men took and satisfactorily
passed the required military examination, and on October 15, 1917 were
commissioned at Fort Dodge as officers in the United States Army. They
were divided into 106 Captains, 329 First Lieutenants and 204 Second
Lieutenants.</p>

<p>During and at the close of the great war, leading white newspapers vied
with each other in filling their columns about the unsurpassed bravery
and patriotism of Colonel “Bill” Hayward, the clear-headed and nervy
white commander and his seasoned Colored 15th Regiment of New York. It
was the first Colored combat regiment to go overseas and was brigaded
with the French fighting forces as the 369th Regiment. To his admiring
Colored soldiers, “Fighting Bill” Hayward was known as “The Hell Man”
and to the surprised Germans the Colored fighters of the old 15th
Regiment were frightfully known as the “Bloodthirsty Black Tigers.”</p>

<p>A few years before that time William Hayward had been elected the
youngest judge in Nebraska and was known in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span> that state as her
“Handsomest Man”. But with all of that previous civic and social honor
and fame, “Fighting Bill” never forgot to be a real “white man” and
gentleman as well as a strict and just commander at all times to his
Colored troops. When resting in camp he regarded and treated them as
human beings and full American citizens, and when in the thickest of
battles he did not ask them to go where he dared not to venture, (if
there ever was such a place). In battlefield action he always led his
men&mdash;he never followed them. This explains why he and his “Black Tigers”
won undying fame and glory by holding a certain sector of trenches at
Bois d’Hause Champagne for ninety-one days and then charging in great
victory over the top of Belleau Woods and the bodies of falling Germans.
It was during a very dangerous charge that a French commander seeing
Hayward and his Colored men about to plunge into what seemed to be a
sure death trap, ordered the American fighters back. Big Bill Hayward
was already in motion and shouted over his shoulder, “My men don’t come
back! They will go through hell, but they won’t come back.” And with
that parting farewell, the “Hell Man” and his impatiently waiting “Black
Tigers” plunged forward and were soon busy serving to the open-mouthed
enemy such a smoking hot dish of scrambled shots, shells, and bayonets
that in swallowing them down those war-hungry Germans at once and for
all times became completely filled and lost their appetites for
everything. On their return after so quickly and efficiently serving
such a well prepared menu, Hayward and his fighters were decorated with
the Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>At Metz, Argonne Forest and St. Dis in the Sectors of Marbacne, Meuse
and Vosges, the newly trained 92nd Colored Division, mostly manned by
Colored officers, went into the thickest of the battles with such
telling effects that fourteen officers and forty-three non-officers were
awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. When those battles were over
and the survivors learned that they had lost from among their chums 209
killed in action, 32 dead from wounds, 589 slightly or severely wounded,
700 overcome by the German’s scientific gases and 18 unaccounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span> for,
the 92nd Division became even more convinced that it had well earned the
many honors and distinctions accorded to it.</p>

<p>Those regiments that were brigaded with the French Army were; the 369th,
370th, 371st, and 372nd Infantries. In the engagements of
Marson-en-Champagne, Minancourt and Bois d’Hause Champagne, the 369th
Infantry (N. Y. 15th) took an active part and it was at
Marson-en-champagne that the whole regiment was cited for deeds of valor
and awarded the Croix de Guerre. It was at Soissons Front that the most
formidable oppositions were successfully faced by the 370th Infantry
(Illinois 8th) that was commanded by Negro officers from Lieut. Col. O.
B. Duncan, down. The final capture of Hill 304 after a severe encounter
by that regiment proved to the Germans that those Colored lads had not
paddled across the “Big Pond” to learn the “Goose Step.” The loss of
1,065 out of 2,384 men signifies the serious activities of the 371st
Infantry in the Champagne Sector between September 18th and October 6th,
1918. Besides the entire regiment receiving citation for extreme
bravery, its regimental colors were decorated. It was this regiment that
broke a standing record at that time by shooting down three German
airplanes on the wing. The 372 Infantry took part in the fighting around
Vacquois Sector and Argonne West, places not very far from the
celebrated Verdun. For distinguished service all along the fighting
lines the whole regiment was decorated with the Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>While the 369th (New York 15th) enjoyed the distinctions of being the
first Colored fighting organization to go overseas into action and the
first Allied division (Colored or white) to reach the banks of the
Rhine; it was the 370th (8th Illinois) Infantry that won the glory of
probably fighting the last engagement of the World War. It appears that
on the morning of November 11, 1918 the French commander sent word to
the officer in charge of the 370th Regiment to cease firing at 11 a.m.
as the Armistice would be signed at that hour. But the Colored troops
were pressing forward so rapidly after the enemy that it was long past
11 a.m. before the messenger could overtake them. When he did finally
ride up to the regiment, it was just putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span> on the finishing “frills
and frazzles” in capturing a German army train and its crews of fifty
supply wagons.</p>

<p>Through the untiring efforts of Dr. Joel E. Spingarn, one of the truest
and most loyal friends the American Colored people have today, Dr. W. E.
B. Dubois, Editor of the Crisis, Col. Charles Young, U. S. Army and many
other prominent Colored leaders and friends of the race, the Secretary
of War authorized on May 19, 1917 the establishment of an Officers’
Reserve Training Camp for Colored soldiers at Fort Des Moines, Iowa.
This is the place where the 639 Colored men mentioned elsewhere in this
article were trained before being commissioned into the United States
Army. After being divided into as equal groups as possible these
officers were ordered to report on November 1, 1917 for regular duty in
the following named camps: Camp Dix, New Jersey; Camp Dodge, Iowa; Camp
Funston, Kansas; Camp Grant, Illinois; Camp Meade, Maryland; Camp
Sherman, Ohio; and Camp Upton, New York.</p>

<h3>Special National Guards</h3>

<p>It was just at that most critical time during the first months of this
same year, (1917) before the United States declared war against Germany,
and when no white man in America positively knew nor absolutely trusted
any other white man as to his real one hundred percent Americanism, that
the Administration called out the first Separate Colored Battalion of
the District of Columbia. This group of well trained and true loyal
American soldiers was made a Special National Guard to defend, from the
enemies of the Government, the Capitol, White House and other important
Federal buildings located in Washington, D.C. the Capital of the United
States of America. The mere fact that the Administration did not select
a white group of soldiers for such a purpose at such a critical time
when spies of the enemy were everywhere in every form proves without a
doubt that the American white people not only had to admit among
themselves but were forced to acknowledge to the whole world that this
was one time in the history of the country when<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span> they had not confidence
enough in members of their own race to intrust to them the Nation’s most
valuable and delicate assets and responsibilities, namely; its
filed-away official records, its treasuries of monies, its cherished
honors and its liberty-loving Government. And the necessary intrusting
of such national assets and responsibilities to the care of Colored
soldiers reminded the outside world (what American white people should
never forget) that the Colored people in the United States form the
backbone of the American nation; especially when the Nation is required
to use that backbone in overthrowing such white traitors of this country
as the despised Benedict Arnold and such white murderers of Presidents
as the scorned J. W. Booth.</p>

<p>That Special Colored Guard of Honor was under a Colored commander, Major
James E. Walker, who at all times intelligently and fearlessly directed
and guided his men in so successfully carrying out that responsible and
trustworthy task. And it was on account of his constant exposure to all
kinds of early spring weather (They started guard duty March 25, 1917.)
while daily and nightly directing and watching the movements of his men,
that Major Walker contracted the incurable cold which resulted in his
fatal illness and untimely death just in the flower of his youth and in
the performance of one of the most confidential and mental-straining
duties the Nation could impose upon a citizen; guarding the history,
good name, wealth and liberty of one hundred ten million people.</p>

<p>In regard to the Colored men who took part in Naval strifes on the high
seas, it has been estimated that at least ten thousand of them served in
the Navy during the World War. While they were not allowed to advance in
the Navy in proportion to their advancement in the Army, nevertheless,
Colored college graduates and students, fully knowing such facts, put
aside for the time being their educational ambitions and careers,
entered the Navy and patriotically as well as unselfishly served in the
menial positions of stewards, cooks and mess boys. And judging from the
sleek full cheeks and plump round bodies of the officers and sailors
aboard the vessels, those Colored boys, who were broad-minded and
big-hearted enough to put down college pride and take up in its place
national patriotism, went into galley and mess rooms and used the same
kind of brain power in wrestling with pots and pans, foods and dishes as
they had so brilliantly used in tussling with slippery mathematical,
historical and linguistic problems when in their college class-rooms.</p>

<p>And who but God has an accurate record of the noble deeds humbly
performed by many of those entrapped and unrescued Colored firemen and
stokers who to the very last possible moment kept up the motor powers of
their vessels in trying to outspeed and outdodge the death dealing
submarine torpedoes? Those swift snakelike missives were always aimed
and usually struck at either the life-giving lungs (fire rooms) or the
pulsating hearts (engine rooms) of their objects. And it was in those
vital organs of several great sea-ploughing vessels where many
feverishly working, loyally dying and unsung Colored heroes went down to
forever sleep in the dark deep chambers of “Father Neptune.”</p>

<p>While their duties, not being on the battle fields nor firing lines,
called forth no spectacular incidents, citations for bravery or award of
medals, nevertheless, the work of the stevedores was as important and
valuable as the efforts of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> other division in the World War. And
their giant strengths and swiftness of movements in loading and
unloading supply transports on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean played a
very very clever part in helping the world to finally get a Zbyszko

Germany and gradually forcing her shoulders backward and flat upon the

<h2>IN THE WORLD WAR
<br /><br />
At Home</h2>

<p>Relative to the willing sacrifices, unfaltering patriotism and loyalty
of the millions of Colored people who remained at home in the United
States during the World War, several books could be written but limited
space herein will not permit but a few paragraphs covering their many
activities.</p>

<p>After the white American men had enlisted or were drafted into the Army
and Navy, there were left vacant thousands and thousands of responsible
positions. The European foreigners who had previously immigrated here
and were immediately given (even before they could understand the laws
of the land or speak its language) full American opportunities and
privileges, except the ballot, were now found unreliable. Great hordes
of them showed their gratefulness to America for earlier throwing wide
open her doors to them by refusing to come up to her test of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span>
hundred percent Americanism. Even after all of the available mothers,
wives, daughters and sisters of the departed white American soldiers
were used in such places, there still remained many thousands of
positions unfilled. All that time millions of Colored men and women who
were loyally and willingly asking and waiting to fill such places were
at first purposely ignored. Because of the lack of sufficient man power,
the cog-wheels of industry all over the country began to stop. It seemed
as though the American white sentiment of prejudiced feeling against the
Colored people had become so bitter that the country was willing to
commit industrial suicide while stopping to wallow in its mires of
racial hatred.</p>

<p>But a certain good white sentiment (that usually turns up sooner or
later, and in some cases more later (than sooner) after great sufferings
have been caused) gently but firmly reminded America that there were
millions of Colored people who were able and willing to fill those
places. They were the people who had made and spent their money here to
enrich and build up America as well as at all times and under all
conditions had proved themselves most loyal and trustworthy citizens.
That reminder although known to be wholly true was still laughed and
sneered at by many until they were suddenly and painfully brought to
realize that they must either employ Colored people in those positions
or let the country go in starvation and ruin for want of sufficient and
proper productions. Colored men and women were then at first reluctantly
given employment in all parts of the country in almost all kinds of
work. Thus for the first time since their forefathers and mothers had
arrived in America nearly three hundred years before, Colored people
were nationally allowed to use and enjoy many of the opportunities and
privileges that had been stingingly withheld from them merely because
they were Negroes and freely given to (many times forced upon) alien
enemies just because they were Caucasians.</p>

<p>Leaving home in the morning long before dawn and returning late after
twilight, Colored men faithfully dug coal in the mines of Alabama, Iowa,
West Virginia and elsewhere in order that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span> various kinds of industrial
plants might continue to run in full blast and that transportation
carriers might quicken their speeds to stations and sea ports. “A. J.
Webster, a coal miner of Buxton, Iowa, is reported to have broken the
record by earning $214.06 in 14 working days, during the last half of
July, 1918. The wage was based on the amount of coal mined.”</p>

<p>In the shipyards along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, where the
long swift-keeled ocean grey hounds and the heavy big-bodied sea-pacing
mastiffs were rapidly born into life, thousands of Colored men were
busily helping to assemble the durable steel ribs into place and rivet
the armorplate hides of those ferocious watch dogs that prowled back and
forth sleeplessly guarding the front doors of their master and
mistress&mdash;“Uncle Samuel” and “Aunt Liberty”. And among those Colored
ship builders, it was Charles Knight and his crew of seven men, who on
July 16, 1918, at the Bethlehem Steel Company’s Sparrow Point, Md.,
plant, drove 4,875 rivets in a 9 hour day. The highest previous record
of 4,442 rivets for the same time had been made in Scotland. Knight and
his men, therefore, were the first Americans (Colored or white) to break
and bring that record to the United States. His regular services for the
day earned him $102; he received a bonus of $50.00 for bringing the
record to America, and twenty-five pounds sterling ($125.00) offered
through the London Daily Mail by Mr. McLeod, the head of a London
Shipbuilding Company, to the one who broke the record. Thus Knight
received for his one day’s labor $277.00, besides having the honor of
being the first American to break the European riveting record.</p>

<p>Many people have heard the time-worn expression “make bricks fly”, but
it has been left for Alonzo Harshaw, a Colored artisan, to break a
record by making bricks fly in laying them at the rate of sixty thousand
paving bricks per day. It is said that Harshaw, who works for the
Southern Paving &amp; Con. Co., lays bricks with such rapidity and exactness
that he has been photographed while at work by several moving picture
firms.</p>

<p>In the rolling mills, steel and iron foundries, Colored men were there
in thousands sweating away their strength and burn<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span>ing up their vitality
before blistering metals in order that the best possible steel and iron
might be made strong and durable enough to withstand the bursting shells
and the snake gliding torpedoes from the submarines of the scientific
Germans.</p>

<p>Pushing pens and pencils on top of desks, tapping keys of clicking
typewriters, bending over buzzing sewing machines, plying needles over
tailors’ benches, before the humming looms, by the dangerous railroad
crossings, in the car-filled train yards, between the handles of loaded
wheelbarrows, through the crops of farmerette fields, among the
death-dealing explosives in munition and arsenal plants and in many
other places, thousands of brave and willing Colored women were to be
found either in yeowomen’s suits or overalls and blouses steadfastly
working with cheery dispositions and hopeful smiles.</p>

<p>In December, 1918, two distinguished Colored Americans were sent to
Europe on special missions as follows; Dr. Robert R. Moton, who was sent
by the President of the United States and the Secretary of War to
investigate the conditions of and talk to the Colored soldiers, and Dr.
W. E. B. DuBois who went to Europe as the representative of the N. A. A.
C. P. and The Crisis to collect historical data pertaining to the
American Colored fighters in the World War and to call and form a
Pan-African Congress.</p>

<h3>At Home Buying Liberty Bonds</h3>

<p>“The Biennial meeting of the National Association of Colored Women’s
Clubs was held in Denver, Colorado in July, 1918. Among the important
subjects considered at this meeting were: Temperance, Suffrage,
Lynchings, Religious Work, Negro Women’s Problems, Food Conservation and
what the Negro Women Were Contributing to War Work Service. It was
pointed out that the Association had representation on the Women’s
Committee of the Council of National Defense, that in the Third Liberty
Loan, 7,000 Negro Women were at work and raised $5,000,000. It was also
stated that, judging from the number of buttons sold through the colored
women’s clubs, that about $300,000 had been contributed in Red Cross
Drives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“David H. Rains, a wealthy Negro farmer, living near Shreveport,
Louisiana, walked into the Liberty Loan Headquarters in that city and
purchased $100,000 worth of the Fourth Liberty Loan Bonds and said that:
‘If they fell short of the quota he would make up the deficiency.’
(Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, pages 48-49). According to
an article on page 273 in the April 1921 issue of The Crisis, ‘Mr.
Rains, who is reputed to be worth $1,500,000, owns 2,000 acres of land
on which there are 40 producing oil wells; he pays a clerk $100 a day to
check up his royalties.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“A report from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was that the Negro school
children subscribed for $27,000 worth of Third Liberty Loan Bonds.
Through a Negro bank in that city, over $400,000 worth of Bonds were
bought, and it was stated that the total amount of Third Liberty Loan
Bonds purchased by the Negroes of Philadelphia was more than
$1,000,000.”</p>

<p>“At the close of the Third Liberty Loan Drive, the United States
Treasury Department awarded first place among all the banks of the
country to a Negro bank, the Mutual Savings, Portsmouth, Virginia. This
bank was given a quota of $5,700 to raise. A total of over $100,000,
almost twenty times the stipulated quota was raised. This bank was
assigned $12,500 as its quota of the Fourth Liberty Loan. Its total
subscription for this loan was reported to have been $115,000.”</p>

<p>“The Negroes of Jacksonville, Florida, were awarded the first honor flag
given to Negroes for exceeding their quota in the Third Liberty Loan
Drive. They were asked to raise $50,000; they raised $250,000. In the
Fourth Liberty Loan Drive, they were assigned a quota of $500,000 and
raised over $100,000 more than this amount. The following are additional
examples of subscriptions of Negroes to the Fourth Liberty Loan: Mobile,
Alabama, $250,000; Norfolk, Virginia, $250,000; Kansas City, Missouri,
$500,000; Savannah, Georgia, $500,000; Memphis, Tennessee, $700,000;
Chicago, Illinois, $1,000,000; Birmingham, Alabama, $1,155,000;
Maryland, $2,000,000.”</p>

<p>“When Secretary McAdoo visited Little Rock, Arkansas, in the interest of
the First Liberty Loan, he was presented with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span> certified check for
$60,000 as the Mosaic Templars’ bit toward financing the war. This
society’s subscriptions were added to for subsequent loans until a total
of $135,000 was invested in Liberty Bonds.”</p>

<p>Not only rich Colored people gave freely of their wealth, but poor
Colored people sacrificed to extents that are not imaginable in giving
their last few dollars to help end that world strife, as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>“Mary Smith, a colored cook in Memphis, Tennessee, was asked by her
mistress if she would not undertake to buy a $100 Bond. Mary said: “No.
I don’t want no little $100 Bond. I want a $1000 and I am going to pay
cash for it.” She gave her lifetime’s savings to help the United States
carry on the war.”</p>

<p>“The Chicago Illinois Post, in an editorial headed: “The Widow’s Mite,”
among other things said: “We should like to tell the story of an old
Negro woman, who, with seamed face and knotted hands, lives on the South
Side and works for $7 a week. ‘Out of these meager wages,’ says the
Favorite Magazine, ‘this daughter of a race that has traveled the road
of trials and tribulations, has purchased three Liberty Bonds and $25
worth of War Savings Stamps. She contributes $5 a month to her
church&mdash;before the war it was $10&mdash;belongs to the N. A. A. C. P. and a
Court of Calanthe, subscribed to three Negro periodicals and contributes
a dollar a month to the Home for the Aged. She does not knit, but she
sits sometimes in the sunset, dreaming of the two stalwart sons that she
has given the nation to fight its battles across the sea’.”<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“Warner Brown, of Brenham, Texas, an ex-slave, seventy-five years old,
had accumulated $50 by chopping wood and doing other jobs. He invested
this in a Liberty Bond.” “Gilbert Denman, an eighty-seven year old Negro
of Greenville, Alabama after listening to an appeal of speakers from a
war relic train, tendered his entire worldly wealth, fifteen cents, to
the cause of the United States Government.”</p>

<p>Since a large percentage of the loyalty and patriotism of American
citizens was weighed on the Roosevelt standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span> testing machine of 100
per cent Americanism with weights of paper, silver and gold money; then
surely the two hundred twenty-five million dollars and more in cash that
was dumped into the American scales of Liberty Loan Campaigns, Thrift
Stamps, Red Cross Drives and other War Work activities, by the Colored
people in the United States, pushed high above the level the opposite
scales that contained Negro one hundred per cent Americanism.</p>

<p>Thus did the Colored people at home give their over-flowing measure and
extra weight of money toward the putting down of a threatened world
autocracy and the establishment of a hopeful universal democracy. And
justly may those Colored people, who stayed at home in America during
the World War and so unselfishly gave of their strength and money,
truthfully and consolingly repeat that beautiful, fifty-fifty and
“square deal” law of King David’s found in First Samuel, thirtieth
chapter, twenty-fourth verse: “But as his part is that goeth down to the
battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff; they shall part
alike.”</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">E</span>VEN during the Revolutionary War, George Leile, a Baptist slave who had
been freed by his owner, preached to slaves in Savannah, Ga. From that
time on up the Negro pulpit has been wielding among the masses of
Colored people in America an influence for good that is the first of all
influences that has the greatest hold upon the Race.</p>

<p>Some of the other early preachers who helped to lay the rock foundation
of this ruling influence were Lemuel Haynes of Connecticut, a wonderful
orator and honored veteran of the Revolutionary War; Richard Allen and
Absolem Jones of Pennsylvania, Allen having founded the famous old
Bethel Church in Philadelphia and was ordained in 1816 the first bishop
of the A. M. E. Church; Amanda Smith of Maryland, who won thousands of
Colored and white converts over to God as a result of her powerful
sermons and temperance lectures in England, Scotland, Africa and India
as well as in America; John Chavis of North Carolina, who on account of
his superior education won fame and recognition as a school teacher of
rich white Southern boys and girls and also as a powerful pulpit
preacher to enslaved men and women of his own race; and John Gloucester
of Tennessee and Pennsylvania, who was the first Colored minister of a
Presbyterian church in the United States. Thus were the ways those early
God-Fearing men and women of days before and right after the Civil War
blazed the plain guiding marks in the forests of ministry, in order that
the clear-sighted and sure-footed gospel leaders who have since followed
them might have no trouble in choosing the right paths through which to
lead their trusting and loyal congregations.</p>

<div class="blockquot3"><p>The following is an article quoted from the August 6, 1921, issue
of the <i>Chicago Defender</i>:</p></div>

<p>“<i>C. T. Walker, Noted Pastor, Dies in South.</i>”&mdash;“Augusta, Ga., Aug.
5&mdash;The Rev. Charles T. Walker, often referred to as the greatest
preacher of his time, died Friday July 29, at his home here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<p>“Dr. Walker was vice-president of the National Baptist convention of the
United States and pastor of the Tabernacle Baptist church here for the
past forty years, excepting five years when he was pastor of the Mount
Olivet Baptist church, New York City.</p>

<p>“He founded the Y.M.C.A. in New York City for our people, traveled
extensively in Europe and the Holy Land, and was the author of a number
of books of travel as well as sermons.</p>

<p>“As an evangelist, he was widely known, and no other minister ever drew
larger crowds when he spoke. His church in this city was often visited
by Northern winter tourists, among them former President Taft and John
D. Rockefeller. It was the latter who paid an artist to paint pictures
of the Christ Child on the walls of Rev. Walker’s church.”</p>

<h3>“To Pastor A Large White Church”</h3>

<p>“Toronto, Can.&mdash;To fill the pulpit of one of the largest Presbyterian
churches (white) in Toronto for five weeks with one of our ministers is
the interesting departure from the general rule of supply for the summer
months that Knox church is making this year. For last week and all of
August, Rev. Joseph J. Hill of Roawohe Baptist Church, Hot Springs,
Ark., will occupy Knox church pulpit. Dr. Hill has been a professor of
science in a southern university, and is a graduate of the Academy of
Music. He is a quiet, appealing and persuasive preacher with a message
all his own, which he delivers with great eloquence. During the summer
holidays, last year, he preached in the Moose Jaw Methodist church, with
a seating capacity of 1,000 which was crowded at all services.”</p>

<p>The above is extracted from the Cleveland Gazette issued August 6, 1921.</p>

<p>As soon as Sunday School children of the Race have grown old and large
enough to understand and bear more weighty religious burdens, they are
at once invited to join the present four million Colored church members,
who are only too anxious to take in new members under the Divine
leadership and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span>tection of the fourty-three thousand churches owned
by people of the Race in the United States. When it is proved by facts
and figures that about one-third of the Colored people in this country
are members in churches and that they have put over eighty-five million
dollars of their hard earned money into these present church properties
they own; it is plainly seen that people of the Negro race still have
perfect faith and trust in and are continuing to work for and with the
God, Who inspired the immortal Abraham Lincoln to free their slave
working and hopeful praying foreparents.</p>

<p>(Ref.: Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, pgs. 1-234-5-6-7).</p>

<p>Colored ministers of today, on account of their all-around advancements
have been able to bring about a better understanding and knowledge of
the true teachings of the Bible. For instance, they are teaching their
congregations that the timely, proper and equal uses of emotional and
practical religion are necessary. Thus the masses of people attending
Colored churches are fast learning from their pulpits that there is just
as much needs for Christianity in practical business and social dealings
with each other on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and
Saturday, as there is for Christianity in their church emotional
ceremonies conducted among themselves before the altars on Sunday. Also
ministers of today have long since come to differ from most of those
“old school” ministers (God blessed them for doing the best they knew
how) who taught their people to live, think and say, to other races,
“Give us Jesus and you can take the dollar.” So the “new school” and
more businesslike ministers of these times are patiently teaching, fast
convincing and gradually converting their congregations in the belief
and truth that it is just as much Christianity in the honest earning,
the frugal saving, the fair investment, the wise spending and the
merciful sharing of a dollar with the poor and needy, as there is need
for Christianity in the saving of their souls and the spreading of the
gospel.</p>

<p>Along other practical lines these gospel leaders are having remarkable
success, especially in large cities where many Colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span> people live. It
is wonderful to see how these practical ministers have taught their
congregations that they are showing as much reverence to God when they
pass out of their churches after services and go quietly and orderly to
their homes (instead of great numbers of them stopping right in front of
their church doors with loud talk and laughter and blocking the whole
pavement, against people who wish to go by, for fifteen and twenty
minutes) as they do when sitting quietly and dignified in their church
pews listening to the sermons. Such gospel leaders in every instance
finally win their members over to their sides in such matters by
pleasantly and plainly pointing out that people of other races seldom
attend Colored churches of today and see the polished and refined ways
people of the Race deport themselves. But if just two or three dozen
members of a church come out after services and thoughtlessly block the
side walks, go along the streets or ride in the trolley cars roughly
laughing and loudly talking their church and private affairs to each
other from one end of the car to the other; they are seen and heard by
other races who class not only the church but the whole Negro race with
those few loud-mouthed, absent-minded and sometimes vain Colored people
who often use such shameful public manners to attract attention to
themselves and their clothes; just like the same class of uncouth white
people do.</p>

<p>Of course, when white men and women appear in public places acting and
talking in noisy, unrefined and vulgar ways, the Colored man or woman
(no matter how little learning he or she may have) who sees and hears
such actions, never judges and stamps the intelligent, refined and
well-behaved portion of the Caucasian race as a whole group of people
also to be ignored and discriminated against. But when a person of color
sees and hears such vulgar actions on the part of a white person, that
Colored person merely comments to himself; “There is a human being who
is a sample of the worse element among the white people and is far from
being a fair and pure sample of the best people in the white race.” Then
that broad-minded Colored person will at once throw the incident off his
mind. He will then turn his back on the uncouth white person with
disgust and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span> in facing about will the very next moment give the fullest
consideration, the most humane treatment, the most polite manners and
the deepest respect to the white lady or gentleman whose Christian
speech and civilized actions warrant and deserve such courtesies. And
this is only one of the countless (big) little instances in which the
American Colored people are daily showing their practical use of the
Golden Rule; (cornerstone in the foundation and keystone in the archway
of the white man’s Christianity).</p>

<p>Thus the brotherhood actions and manners of the masses of Negroes, (from
the hod-carrier to the president of a university and from the scrub
woman to the president of a national organization) in being broad-minded
and big-hearted enough to fair-mindedly apply the Golden Rule to the
Caucasian race, so as to mentally separate and treat accordingly the
good white people from the bad, are certainly proving that the Colored
people as a whole are daily putting into practical usages the Lord’s
Golden Rule in much more Christlike ways than the white race is itself.
Of course, there are exceptions in both races, but considering both from
the standpoint of masses the above assertion cannot be truthfully
denied.</p>

<p>A present day exception on the white side may be cited as
follows:&mdash;During the summer of 1920 when Southern white savages turned
Paris, Texas into a human slaughter house by lynching, torturing and
burning alive of human beings, Rev. R. P. Shuler, (white) a prominent
Methodist minister living in that community fearlessly denounced the mob
at the time of its heathenish actions and at the risk of his own life.
Later, when speaking of a former statement he had made regarding the
lynching, according to an article in the July 24, 1920 issue of the
Chicago Defender, he said:</p>

<p>“The above statement, I make in the face of the advice that has come to
me from many friends that such a policy is and will be at present unsafe
for me. I am informed that my life has been numerously threatened if I
make such a statement. I am told that the mob used my name repeatedly in
such a manner as to very much concern my friends. I can truthfully say
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span> the attitude of this mob toward me does not in the least concern
me. Better men than myself have died when far less was at stake. I am
only concerned in doing my God-appointed duty in this situation.
Therefore, without apology or plea for quarter, I unhesitatingly condemn
the burning of these men in our city as an act of lawlessness, which if
carried to its legitimate ends, would destroy our government and damn
our civilization. And in making this statement I ask for neither the
protection of my friends nor the mercy of my enemies.”</p>

<p>If all other white ministers were to take such fearless and open stands
against such savage doings, that are heaping as much shame and stain on
the United States as such crimes in Europe ever heaped on Turkey, they
could in a few years make these United States a truly Christian land.
And in taking such stands such ministers (if they showed the same kind
of faith in God as Rev. Shuler did who is still living and preaching)
they would also be delivered from a threatening mob. But where within
the recent past or the present have there stepped out from the white
ministry two Rev. Shulers? Among all the nationally famed white
evangelists, which one or three of recent times have in preaching in all
parts of the United States proved himself a second Henry Ward Beecher,
an Elijah P. Lovejoy or a C. T. Torry, who fearlessly and fruitfully
preached against all national as well as local sins, crimes and
lawlessness that came under their notice?</p>

<p>Among all the white ministers in the United States, only they themselves
can tell how many of them peacefully feel within their secret hearts and
contentedly feel within their reasoning minds that they are giving full
reverences to God, full honor to their calling and full service toward
all weak and suffering humanity through their Sunday preachings against
all sins and crimes? And among them only they can tell how many of them,
through advising words in reasoning talks, are trying each Sunday (if
only for five minutes) to blow out and drown the sinful sparks of
jealousy, envy, malice and hate that instantly flame up in the breasts
of so many of their church members as soon as they see a Colored person,
even if that person is well-behaved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span> well-educated, well-dressed and
well-to-do. Such feelings merely on account of color are not natural and
God has not meant for such to be; for if He had, He would have made the
brown earth white, the green grass white, the blue sky white, the yellow
sun white. These are the greatest things in the world and all of them
are colored. Even the water, that covers three-fourths of the earth
(while it is supposed to be colorless) is more colored than it is white.
Those white people who wish that there were no colored on earth should
remember that God in His infinite wisdom fully realized in making the
universe that if He made all things white the glare would be so great
and intense that every seeing thing would be driven totally blind. So
God put soft and blending colors on earth in order that humanity might
retain its sight to see His works and learn to love them but not to look
upon any of His works with scorn and hatefulness.</p>

<p>While intelligent preachers of the Race upon quietly and carefully
looking about them see that practically the entire earth is one mass of
colors&mdash;the majority of internal and external earth elements, the foods,
the clothes, inside and outside building materials and furnishings are
colored; yet these Negro ministers teach their congregations that the
white color God has placed here has as much right on earth as the big
majority of colors. And there are such advising and logical talks going
on every Sunday from the Colored pulpits in order to keep down race
prejudice and friction. And Colored ministers are silently and hopefully
praying to God that He will finally soften, melt and move the hearts of
the white ministers so that they will at last come forward and do their
parts by logic reasonings with their white congregations a few minutes
every Sunday regarding the rights of all colors of peoples to live
unmolested and progress unhindered here on earth. It has been left for
the white press to come forward and take the lead (which it is nobly and
increasingly doing) in this movement of reasoning with the masses of
white people in America regarding racial discriminations and injustices.
But the entire world, including the American white press itself, is
looking on in puzzled and wondering silence as it continues to hopefully
wait for the American white ministry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span> dutifully and courageously come
forward in a mass and take its rightful lead in this Christian movement
to help bring about a closer brotherhood co-operation, a truer
Christlike understanding and a smoother racial adjustment between the
white and Colored people living in the United States. The influence of
the white church is the greatest human power in the world&mdash;it
unintentionally encourages mobs and rioting in America by continuing to
keep silent on the question, but it can intentionally discourage and
prevent in a very short time the occurence of a second Arkansas,
Atlanta, Chester, Chicago, Duluth, East St. Louis, Houston,
Philadelphia, Tulsa, Washington and other race riots, if it will come
out as a whole all over the country and speak to its congregations
Sunday after Sunday against such barbarism and heathenism being
constantly carried on here in the United States.</p>

<p>According to notices that have recently appeared in the white press, The
Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, spurred on by the
barbarisms carried on at the riot of Tulsa, Okla. of a few months ago,
has boldly come forward and denounced such sins and crimes. In order to
bring about better relations between the two Races and help to prevent
such future occurences, this Council has already appointed a Commission
that has held a meeting in Washington, D.C. It is planned to hold
conferences, composed of white and Colored clergymen, all over the
country, and an effort will be made to have the white churches to
educate their audiences regarding the sins of race prejudice and the
crimes resulting therefrom. So just as God in His own time answered the
prayers of American slaves that they and their children would some day
become free; He is gradually and surely answering the prayers of
persecuted Negroes of today that the white ministry will come forward
and take its proper place as a leader in helping to swing into the right
channels the public sentiments of white people regarding their
Christlike treatments of Colored neighbors. Colored people must continue
to work and pray and be hopeful that out of this movement will
eventually come a second Henry Ward Beecher of modern times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IN_THE_SUNDAY_SCHOOLS" id="IN_THE_SUNDAY_SCHOOLS"></a>IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>N no surroundings of childhood, except the home life, is there a more
suitable or fruitful place in which to spiritually nourish and grow up
Colored youths than in the forty-six thousand or more Colored Sunday
Schools where over two million boys and girls are regularly having
impressed upon their tender and open minds the religious teachings of
the Bible.</p>

<p>As a step toward further broadening the Sunday School work among
American Colored children and at the same time enabling them to get
better teachings about the Christian religion, The International Sunday
School Association began in 1911 to organize classes for specially
training Sunday School teachers among the young men and women attending
Colored colleges and large schools. Many white friends to the Race
became interested in this good movement, especially Mr. W. N. Hartshorn
of Boston, Mass., who gave of his own personal money $15,000 to pay the
expenses of a fair trial of the work. This Christian effort has aroused
so much interest and has grown so rapidly that at present upward of two
hundred Colored universities, colleges and large schools have accepted
and given this Sunday School Teachers’ Course a regular place in their
class room studies.</p>

<p>Some of the foremost religious leaders who are helping to direct and
carry on this much needed work among American Colored children are
Bishop Geo. W. Clinton and Dr. R. H. Boyd, both life members of the
International Sunday School Association; Prof. Wm. B. Matthews, member
of the Executive Committee of the above association, Dr. H. G. Lyman,
Supt. of work among Colored people, and Mr. M. L. Finckel, President of
the American Sunday School Union. (Ref.: Work’s Negro Year Book,

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">U</span>NDER the sisterly and wise supervision of Miss Eva D. Bowles, as the
first salaried Y. W. C. A. Colored branch secretary in New York City and
since then Executive of Colored Work, the Young Women’s Christian
Association for Colored girls and women has made wonderful progress,
since 1907 when Mrs. Wm. A. Hunton was appointed by the National Board
to investigate and arouse interest in the work. As Special Student
Worker, Miss Catherine Lealted greatly aided in building up and
strengthening this work in Colored schools until she took up work in
another field of uplift.</p>

<p>Today there are over fifty city Y. W. C. A. Colored Branches in as many
cities in 23 states and the District of Columbia; while there are at
least 100 such branches in Colored schools located in 18 States and the
District of Columbia. Just as the school branches are the means of
helping to build up and fortify the practical Christian minds of the
girls who join them; the city branches prove sheltering havens and
protections for self-respecting and self-supporting Colored single girls
and women when they leave such schools and respectable homes to embark
upon the rough oceans of life and desire to nightly anchor in places of
moral protection, social uplift, mental development, sanitary
conditions, congenial companionships, pleasures of innocence and
Christian influences. For the safe arrival and calm anchorage of such
Colored girls and women, the writer assures them that the following list
of addresses is a true compass needle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span> that will, when they set-sail for
a new city port, safely guide them into any of the following

<p>Among the foremost Y. W. C. A. Colored leaders who are so nobly and ably
assisting Miss Eva D. Bowles in the smooth and efficient supervision of
the above named branches are Misses May B. Belcher, Crystal Bird, Mabel
Brady, Mary E. Jackson, Josephine Pinyon, Lucy B. Richmond, Adele F.
Ruffin, Clayda Williams, Mrs. Charlton Wallace, and Mrs. Cordella A.
Winn. Before her death on December 31, 1919, Mrs. Marie A. Wilder was
one of the most faithful and hardest workers in the above group.</p>

<p>But the main stream of success connected with this work has come about
through the “working together” “branch relationship” co-operation on the
parts of Mrs. Samuel J. Broadwell, Treasurer; Miss Mable Cratty, Gen’l
Sec’y; Mrs. Jas. S. Cushman, 1st Vice-Pres.; Mrs. John French, Chairman
Execu. Com.; Mrs. Lewis H. Lapham, Sec’y; Mrs. Wm. W. Rossiter, 2nd
Vice-Pres.; and Mrs. Robt. E. Speer, President, who compose the National
Board (white) of The Young Womens Christian Association of the United
States of America. And in the different cities where they are
established the white and Colored branch workers are carrying on the
above co-operations. During the World War, the War Work Council showed
its co-operation by appointing a Colored Work Committee with Miss Eva D.
Bowles as Executive and Mrs. Charlton Wallace as Chairman and, The War
Work Council, “recognizing the loyalty and need of the colored girls and
women in this country, appropriated $400,000 for the work.”</p>

<p>In speaking of the work of this committee Miss Bowles said, “The Y. W.
C. A. is the only organization that is handling the work with all girls
alike, and the result of its efforts is bound to be the building up of
the confidence of the colored race, not only in the nation itself but in
Christianity. With the colored, as with all other women and girls
throughout the world, the aim of the Y. W. C. A. is a constructive
foundation of Christian ideals. Girls are girls, whatever their race or
complexion. As naturally as a flower demands sunshine and rain, a girl
craves good times, pretty clothes and happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span>”</p>

<p>In closing this vital chapter, the writer can think of no better way
than to quote the following words of Miss Bowles when she summed up the
past and pointed out the future regarding the leaderships of Colored
women among their own people in the United States.</p>

<p>“The war has given opportunity to the colored woman to prove her ability
for leadership. She had her chance and she made good. With all the
strength of having suffered, she will be able, through the patience born
of suffering, to lead the women and girls whom only she can lead. The
time is past for white leadership for colored people. As white and
colored women, we must understand each other, we must think and work and
plan together for upon all of us rests the responsibility of the
girlhood of our nation.”</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE 110 Negro college Young Men’s Christian Associations and the fifty
or more city branches is as many cities in twenty-three different states
in the Union are really God-sends to thousands of young Colored men who
prefer to spend their spare minutes in the best places of physical
cleanliness, social purity and mental advancement. These “Y” branches in
the cities are also great blessings for thousands of intelligent,
refined and progressive Colored men who are constantly visiting strange
places on important businesses and want to be sure they are stopping in
modern, sanitary, decent, respectable and congenial lodgings.</p>

<p>Mr. Julius Rosenwald of Chicago, Ill. made an offer in 1911 to give the
sum of $25,000 to every city in the United States that would raise
$75,000 by public subscription for the construction of a Y. M. C. A.
building for the use of Colored people. This offer was gladly and
eagerly accepted and as a result buildings have already been erected in
Atlanta, Ga., Baltimore, Md., Brooklyn, N.Y., Chicago, Ill., Columbus,
O., Indianapolis, Ind., Kansas City, Mo., New York City, N. Y.,
Philadelphia, Pa., Pittsburgh, Pa., St. Louis, Mo., and Washington, D.C.
During the past ten years Mr. Rosenwald has given $350,000 toward the
erection of these buildings, other white people have given nearly a
million dollars, while Colored people have contributed over a quarter of
a million dollars. Thus over two million dollars have already been
expended in the construction of Y. M. C. A. buildings in cities for
Colored men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span></p>

<p>Great credit for the early development and rapid growth of this work is
due the late W. A. Hunton, who was made a member on the staff of the
International Secretary Board of the Y. M. C. A. Today this work is
continuing to rapidly grow and spread with the friendly co-operation and
hearty support of Messrs. B. H. Fancher, Treas., A. E. Marling, Chairman
and J. R. Mott, Gen’l Sec’y of The International Committee of the Y. M.
C. A., and under the wise supervision of Dr. J. E. Mooreland, who is
being ably assisted by H. K. Craft, W. C. Craver, R. P. Hamlin, C. H.
Tobias, J. B. Watson, Max Yergen and other efficient members on that
large staff. During the World War 350 Y. M. C. A. Colored Secretaries,
under the guidance of Dr. J. E. Moorland, R. B. DeFrantz, W. J.
Faulkner, J. F. Gregory and G. L. Johnson loyally served Colored
soldiers stationed in 55 camps, training schools and forts in America.
Among those who were the leaders in Y. M. C. A. and social work among
the Colored soldiers over-seas were J. E. Blanton, Mrs. Helen Curtis,
Miss Helen Hagan, Dr. John Hope, Mrs. Addie Hunton, Miss Katherine
Johnson, Dr. B. M. Murrell, Dr. H. H. Proctor, C. H. Williams and Max
Yergen.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>HILE they went about their self-imposed and greatly beneficial tasks in
somewhat crude ways that were executed under circumstances far more
trying and peculiar than these modern times; nevertheless, Harriet
Tubman and Sojourner Truth may be rightly called the first real welfare
and uplift national workers among American Colored women. And the
histories of the untiring efforts, speakings and lectures of those two
pioneers who fearlessly worked for the freedom of their Race sisters and
brothers should be learned by all Colored youths, especially girls.</p>

<p>While leading Colored women throughout the country as far back as 1894
had already decided and carefully planned to gather and form some kind
of a national body among themselves, they were indeed suddenly inspired
to whole-heartedly and fearlessly carry out those plans immediately,
when a prejudiced white editor of a village paper in the United States
published an open letter in which he accused alike all American Colored
women as being without moral characters and uplifting principles. Not
only the educated, refined and moral Colored women resented and
challenged that poisoned-pen letter that had lied on and slandered a
whole race of their sisters, but the largest nationally known white
newspapers of large cities in both America and Europe came out in
broad-minded editorials verbally chastising and denouncing without mercy
that editor of their race who stained his profession and shamed his race
by stooping so low in unsuccessfully using that narrow-minded and
short-sighted means of gaining subscriptions for his failing paper and
fame for his unheard of name.</p>

<p>As a result of the above plans and decisions nearly a dozen States sent
upward of a hundred leading and representative Colored women who met in
July 1895 in Boston, Mass., where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span> first National Convention of
Colored Women was formed, with Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin as
president, Mrs. Booker T. Washington and Mrs. Helen Cook as
Vice-Presidents and Miss Elizabeth C. Carter as secretary. During the
meeting that convention was given the name of “The National Association
of Colored Women.” This body became affiliated with The National Council
of Women in 1900 and was incorporated in 1904. At different times it has
had as its presidents; Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, A. M., Washington,
D.C., Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Tuskegee Institute, Ala., Miss
Elizabeth C. Carter, New Bedford, Mass., Mrs. Mary B. Talbert, Buffalo,
N. Y. and Miss Hallie Q. Brown, Wilberforce, Ohio, who is its present
presiding officer. Those who are Miss Brown’s closest assistants in
helping to carry on this noble work are named as follows: Mrs. Janie
Porter Barrett, Peake, Va., Mrs. Ruth L. Bennett, Chester, Pa., Mrs.
Alice Cary, Atlanta, Ga., Mrs. Charlotte Dett, Niagara Falls, N. Y.,
Mrs. Addie W. Dickerson, Phila., Pa., Mrs. C. L. Hamilton, Indianola,
Ill., Mrs. C. R. McDowell, Hannibal, Mo., Mrs. J. C. Napier, Nashville,
Tenn., Miss Georgia A. Nugent, Louisville, Ky., Mrs. Minnie Scott,
Toledo, Ohio, Mrs. E. J. N. Simms, Spokane, Wash., Mrs. Mamie E.
Steward, Louisville, Ky., Mrs. Marion Wilkerson, Orangeburg, S. C. and
Mrs. W. T. B. Williams, Tuskegee Institute, Ala.</p>

<p>In regard to the relations of this association with the International
Council of Women, several Colored women have attended different European
meetings as representatives from the United States. Foremost among such
women are Miss Hallie Q. Brown, Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, Mrs. Mary B.
Talbert and Dr. Mary F. Waring. The following is an extract from the
July 1921 issue of The Crisis:</p>

<p>“The Committee on International Relations&mdash;the highest committee of
women in personnel of representatives in the League of Nations&mdash;has
chosen Mrs. Mary B. Talbert as a member. Mrs. Talbert was the first
accredited Negro delegate to sit in the International Council of women
and one of five American women to speak for the National Council of
Women of the United States of America in the House of Parliament at
Norway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The quotation below is taken from the February 1921 issue of The
Favorite Magazine. “Dr. Mary F. Waring, recently returned from a trip
through eleven European countries, and one of twenty American women to
represent the United States at the International Council of Women in
Norway. She had the distinction of being the only woman commissioner of
the Lincoln Jubilee in 1915 and the organizer of the Red Cross units
Canteen and Home Nursing classes during the World War. After the war the
Community Service appointed her as a national organizer for girls’
work.”</p>

<p>Some of the national leading and most prominent Colored women before the
public today who as workers in this association or along other elevating
lines have encouraged, inspired and helped thousands of American Colored
girls to move out of Nobody’s Alley and live on Somebody’s Avenue are

<h3>The National Negro Business League</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>N 1900 the late Dr. Booker T. Washington, founder of Tuskegee
Institute, organized in Boston, Mass. The National Negro Business
League, which is now under the forceful and energetic leadership of Dr.
Robert R. Moton. Such nationally known men as Chas. Banks, J. C. Napier
and Emmett J. Scott are among those who are closely allied with the
president of this League in so widely spreading its influences of
encouragement, inspiration and business knowledge.</p>

<p>As a description of the workings of this organization, the writer gives
below some extracts from an article written for the August 13, 1921
issue of The Chicago Defender by E. Davidson Washington, son of the late
Dr. Booker T. Washington.</p>

<p>“While the Business League has a distinctive purpose (that of promoting
the commercial and financial development of our Race,) it does not
attempt to prescribe for every racial endeavor; yet it is a significant
fact that through the instrumentality of this the national body and its
more than 600 local branches or local leagues scattered throughout the
country a very large part of the progress made by the Race in the
direction of home and farm ownership, banking, insurance, manufacturing
and mercantile enterprises has been achieved since the organization of
the Business League.</p>

<p>“Among the many subjects discussed are such as: “Making Farming Pay,”
“Building a Negro Town,” “The Relation of Education to Business,”
“Conducting a Grocery Store,” “Editing a Newspaper” and many others
which space will not permit me to mention here. Questions are asked, and
in that way those who did not come up to their expectations the previous
year try, when they return to their various communities, as far as
possible, to put into practice what they have gained through the league.</p>

<p>“The symposiums conducted in the main convention by the following
organizations are highly interesting and instructive:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> The National
Negro Bankers’ Association, the National Negro Funeral Directors’
Association, the National Negro Press, the National Negro Bar
Association and the National Negro Insurance Men.</p>

<p>“Finally, as a Race we must not be discouraged. There will come to us,
as to all races, seasons of depression and gloom. Once in a while even
those in high places may seem to seek to insult, humiliate and harass
us, but they cannot last. “The morning cometh.” Those who treat us
unjustly are losing more than we are. Above all, we must not lose faith
in ourselves nor in our Race. We must be as proud of being Negroes as a
Japanese is of being a Japanese. It is through such meetings as the
National Negro Business League that the Negro is encouraged and made to
look upon the brighter side of life and with more optimism for the
future than ever before.”</p>

<h3>Association For The Study of Negro Life and History</h3>

<p>American school white boys and girls get the larger part of their
inspirations to become great men and women mostly from what they read in
the public school United States Histories about big things members of
their race have done. As white authors in writing such histories saw fit
to leave out of them all references (with the exception of slavery) to
the parts the American Colored people have had in helping to make
American history, public school Colored boys and girls get no racial
encouragements nor inspirations from such histories.</p>

<p>The Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, organized in
1915, is doing a grand work in helping to supply the American Colored
youth with the desired encouraging and inspiring information relating to
Negro historical achievements in the United States. The president of
this organ, R. E. Park is ably assisted in this work by such scholars as
Drs. J. E. Mooreland and C. G. Woodson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span></p>

<h3>The National Equal Rights League</h3>

<p>The National Equal Rights League was started in 1910 and one of its
chief purposes is contending for and securing in peaceful but firm ways
the same equal rights in the United States for American Colored citizens
as those so generously given to members of other races, especially many
foreigners in this country who do not understand the laws, cannot speak
the language and have no intentions of becoming naturalized. The
president of this organization is N. S. Taylor, who is loyally assisted
by such race leaders as Wm. Monroe Trotter, and B. N. Murrell.</p>

<h3>The Lincoln League of America</h3>

<p>The Lincoln League of America is an organization that was started in
1919, and one of its main objects is to instil race pride on a broader
scale among Colored people and at the same time encourage them along all
lines of citizenship privileges and advancement. Roscoe C. Simmons is
president of this body and is nobly aided in this work by such national
figures as Henry Lincoln Johnson and Walter Cohen.</p>

<h3>National Association of Teachers for Colored Schools</h3>

<p>The National Association of Teachers for Colored Schools is under the
scholarly and experienced leadership of Prof. J. M. Gandy. It is due
mostly to this organization that the managements and sentiments of the
different Southern Colored colleges and schools have come to better
understand each other and thereby work in closer conjunction and harmony
for the broadest and most practical development of Negro youths in both
industrial and higher education. Other officials who have helped to
bring about such good feelings are S. X. Floyd and W. H. A. Howard.</p>

<h3>Negro Organization Society</h3>

<p>Although it has not yet developed into a national organization, the
Negro Organization Society of Virginia is making rapid strides in that
direction. It was organized several years ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span> at the wise suggestion
of the late Dr. H. B. Frissell, by Major R. R. Moton, who with the
valuable assistance of Captain Allen Washington, Profs. J. M. Gandy, T.
C. Erwin, Rev. A. A. Graham, Lawyer T. C. Walker, Hon. Robert. E. Clay
and others soon made it a leading source of encouragement and
helpfulness throughout the entire State. While its purpose is to unite
into one large solid body for more mutual understandings all the church,
fraternal and social organizations and societies, big and little, in the
State; it has no desires nor intentions whatever of selfishly absorbing
within itself or taking away the individuality of any organized body
that comes under its advice and help.</p>

<p>One of the chief objects of this society is to gather all such
organizations in the state under its guiding wisdom and sheltering arms
into one big congenial family, whose members may then be constantly
taught how best to work in helpful understandings and harmony among
themselves and in brotherhood co-operations with their white neighbors
in order to secure “better health, better schools, better homes and
better farms” for the Colored people. These efforts have proven so
fruitful that this society has already overflown its Virginian cup of
uplift influence that is now running and dripping over the sides into
surrounding states. And under the continued successful “Whooping-up”
campaigns of its present leader, Major Allen Washington, this organ is
destined some day to become one of the most helpful national movements
in America in aiding to bring about stronger and broader good-will
feelings between the two races and at the same time more friendly and
solidly uniting all Colored organizations for a more rapid and all-round
advancement of the Negro Race.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PAN-AFRICAN_CONGRESS" id="THE_PAN-AFRICAN_CONGRESS"></a>THE PAN-AFRICAN CONGRESS</h2>

<p>On February 19, 1919, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, editor of The Crisis, called
a meeting known as The Pan-African Congress that held three days’
session in the Grand Hotel, Paris, France. It was attended by
fifty-eight delegates representing sixteen different Negro groups, who
passed resolutions of which two of the most important paragraphs are
quoted below as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

<p>“Whenever persons of African descent are civilized and able to meet the
tests of surrounding culture, they shall be accorded the same rights as
their fellow citizens: they shall not be denied on account of race or
color a voice in their own Government, justice before the courts and
economic and social equality according to ability and desert.</p>

<p>“Whenever it is proven that African natives are not receiving just
treatment at the hands of any State or that any State deliberately
excludes its civilized citizens or subjects of Negro descent from its
body politic and cultural, it shall be the duty of the League of Nations
to bring the matter to the attention of the civilized world.”</p>

<p>Along with Dr. DuBois, some of the other internationally known persons
who attended that first Congress were Boisneuf, Deputy from Guadaloupe;
Captain Boutte; Canadace, French Deputy from Guadaloupe; Mme Chapoteau;
Mrs. Helen M. Curtis; Diagne, French Deputy from Senegal; Grossilliere,
Deputy from Martinique; Mrs. Ida Gibbs Hunt; Mrs. Addie W. Hunton; Dr.
John Hope; President King, Peace Delegate from Liberia; B. F. Seldon and
Roscoe C. Simmons.</p>

<p>The Pan-African Congress plans to hold its second meeting in Europe in
1921 and hold sessions in four different countries as follows: in
London, England on August 28th and 29th; in Brussels, Belgium on August
31st, September 1st and 2nd; in Paris, France on September 4th and 5th,
and a “Special Committee to visit the Assembly of the League of Nations,
Geneva, Switzerland, after September 6th.”</p>

<p>In brief (according to the July 1921 issue of The Crisis) the chief
working plans mapped out on the practical progress of this Congress are
as follows: to satisfy the urgent need of securing first-hand
information “about Africa’s physical, climatic and commercial
conditions, as well as the attitude of the natives and the European
governments”; to thresh such newly gained knowledge and put it into the
form of a statement, presenting the main social problems which face the
Negros of the world; to enable the leaders of the different Negro groups
the world over to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span>come acquainted; to get in touch with and put
before those persons, groups, nations and organizations of various races
who either do sympathize with the peoples of Africa and their
descendants or who would sympathize with them if they knew the
fundamental characteristics, needs and deserts of the black man all over
the globe; to have the Pan-African Congress finally evolved into one
permanent body that welds the Negro people and their friends for the
emancipation of the race.</p>

<p>“For his services in originating and conducting in Paris the Pan-African
Congress”, Dr. DuBois was presented with the Spingarn Medal. And this
Pan-African Congress, “in the judgment of President Hope of Morehouse
College”, “made the Negro representatives from seventeen countries
discover that the problems of colored people the world over are the
same.” The origin and purpose of the above mentioned Spingarn Medal is
explained in the following quotation:</p>

<p>“A few years ago Dr. J. E. Spingarn of New York decided that he would
offer each year a gold medal to be awarded to the man or woman of
African descent who had rendered valuable, though perhaps somewhat
inconspicuous, service to his race and to modern civilization. Dr.
Spingarn had very clearly in his mind the “for merit” type of
decoration. This idea has always been kept before the committee on
award”. (Ref. July 1920 issue of the Southern Workman).</p>

<p>A complete list of those who have been awarded the Spingarn Medal since
1915, when it was first presented, up to the present date is as follows:</p>

<p class="nind4">
1915, Dr. Ernest E. Just, Scholar-Scientist.<br />
1916, Colonel Chas. Young, United States Army.<br />
1917, Harry T. Burleigh, Singer-Composer.<br />
1918, Wm. Stanley Braithwaite, Poet-Critic.<br />
1919, Archibald H. Grimke, Author-Orator.<br />
1920, Dr. W. E. B. DuBoise, Sociologist-Author.<br />
1921, Charles E. Gilpin, Celebrated Actor.<br />

<h2><a name="MARCUS_GARVEY" id="MARCUS_GARVEY"></a>MARCUS GARVEY</h2>

<p>Whatever may be their private thoughts and judgements as to the methods,
purposes and final results of his efforts; the one conclusion at which
close observing Colored and white people alike have unanimously arrived
and publically admitted is that the Negro, Marcus Garvey (who is
estimated to have united more than a million of his Race people into
different organizations) has unquestionably become “The World’s Greatest
Group Organizer” of today.</p>

<p>Relative to the Race interests, efforts and leaderships of Dr. DuBois
and Mr. Garvey, the writer quotes below the very logical and impartial
editorial that appeared in Editor J. Finley Wilson’s “Washington Eagle”
that was published September 17, 1921, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<div class="blockquot4"><p class="c">“WORLD LEAGUE OF THE AFRICAN RACES NECESSARY”</p>

<p>“We are very much in favor of the Pan-African movement which Dr. W.
E. B. DuBois has in charge and is trying to make a success of. The
race needs an international organization which will gather
representatives of the African peoples of the world, where their
rights and wrongs may be registered and looked after, and where,
annually, they may gather in an open congress or a discussion and
agreement upon questions affecting them. The question is a broad
one, race-embracing, and should be considered from that viewpoint.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, we are very much in favor of the movement
fostered by Mr. Marcus Garvey, the provisional president of Africa,
to create a sentiment in Africa in favor of a oneness of sentiment
among Africans themselves and the building up of African States for
Africans. Mr. Garvey has been pointing out, recently, and very
wisely, we think, that the time may come when Afro-Americans who
are dissatisfied with their conditions in States of the United
States may desire to go to Africa, and to a State in Africa
governed by Africans. This is reasonable foresight.</p>

<p>“There are millions of Jews working hard for the rehabilitation of
Palestine who have no desire to make it their home, as they are
satisfied in the States where they are, but there are millions who
are not satisfied, as in Turkey and Russia, who would go to
Palestine and build its waste places while repatriating it. It is
in the same way that we regard the building of a strong African
State as a sufficient asylum of those of the race who are
persecuted anywhere on the globe that they may be.</p>

<p>“Mr. Garvey is as much of a prophet in his way as Dr. DuBois, and
we should be willing to hold up the hands of both of them in any
plans they may advance which seems possible of working out for the
good of the race. Both of them have ideas and methods we do not
approve, but that would be the case with any movement whatsoever,
that may be started, on a large or small scale, by any man or group
of men of the race, but it should not prevent us from encouraging
them in any idea or plan which appears reasonable and possible of
resulting in good for the race.</p>

<p>“A World League of African People is necessary. An Independent
African State in Africa is necessary. We already have Liberia and
Abyssinia, but we need more than these, and stronger than both of
them.”</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">S</span>INCE the raising of tobacco, cotton, corn, sugar cane and other farm
products had been the main reason for starting slavery in America, it is
plainly seen that farming was the chief work of the Colored people until
they were set free. And it is quite natural that they took a great
dislike to a work that they had been compelled to do against their wills
for over two hundred years. So at the close of the Civil War when they
were free to choose their own work, the majority of ex-slaves were
willing to do any kind of labor under the sun (or over the sun for that
matter) but work on the farm. Such a state of affairs continued for a
number of years and caused much of the rich fertile lands in the South
to go unfarmed, neglected and runned-down, but after some years away
from the only kind of work they knew the most about, their dislike to
farming began to lessen and they gradually drifted back to work patches
of land on shares with their former owners who had survived the war. And
their return to the bosom of nature rapidly increased as the ex-slaves
saw how it would enable them to make a living and save money to buy land
for themselves.</p>

<p>As a result of that movement back to the farms which continued to
increase, there were, according to the 1910 census, over two hundred
thousand farms or twenty-one million acres of land owned in the United
States by Colored people. Negroes in the South alone own more than two
hundred thousand of those farms that are valued at more than four
hundred million dollars. Just in the state of Virginia Colored people
own over one million acres of land that are valued at over ten million
dollars. The following named are just a handful of the Colored farmers
throughout the South and West who own and cultivate farms ranging in
size from 500 to 3,000 acres of land; J. N. Brown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span> Tenn.,; J. Collins,
S. C.; Robt. Chatman, Texas; Wash Dillard, Texas; Lewis Dolphin, Okla.;

Pollard, H. Penneth, Jack Taylor, Texas; Jake Simmons, Okla.; R. L.
Smith, Newton Smith, La.; A. W. Taylor, Texas; J. Thompson, Ga.; W. B.
Turner, Va., and Frank Wallace, Texas.</p>

<p>Through the encouragement and helpfulness of such farming agencies as
the Smith-Lever Funds for Agricultural Extension Education, the
Smith-Hughes Funds for Vocational Education, The Federal Farm Loans and
the Farmers’ Co-operative Demonstration Work, a new interest, rekindled
enthusiasm and extra efforts have been aroused among Colored farmers in
all parts of the country. They have at last been made to plainly see and
fully understand that it is always to their seemingly dull country
barnyard gates that the boiled-shirt, stiff-collared and learned
business and college men of the cities must sooner of later turn for
their ham and eggs, steak and chops, bread and butter and different
vegetables. These same farmers manfully realize that they or others can
only produce such necessities of life by daily mingling among the
neighing horses, the mooing cows, the grunting pigs, the bleating sheep,
the cackling hens and the crowing roosters. They are the people who with
rolled-up sleeves cheerfully feel they must be stained with the earth’s
sweet dirt (for what is so fragrant, so refreshing and so sweet as the
smell of newly plowed furrows on an early spring morn, when crows
overhead fly with taunting caws and robins scratch the sods for a wormy
cause?) or the city folks for want of life-giving foods would soon die
of starvation.</p>

<p>In order to help prevent the above dreaded calamity overtaking the
country by learning how to better intensify crops and redouble their
products, Colored farmers both young and old are taking either short or
full courses in scientific agriculture in the following named schools
that are a few among the many giving such instructions:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span></p>

<p>Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College for Negroes, Normal, Ala.;
Agricultural &amp; Industrial State School, Nashville, Tenn.; Agricultural &amp;
Technical College, Greensboro, N. C.; Agricultural &amp; Normal University.,
Langston, Okla.; Alcorn Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College, Alcorn,

Tuskegee Normal &amp; Industrial Institute, Tuskegee, Ala. (extracts from
Negro Year Book, 1918-1918 edition, pgs. 2-308-345)</p>

<p>As soon as Colored men have finished agricultural courses in the above
named or other schools, they are fully prepared to locate in any section
of the country and put into practice the farming theories they have just
learned. It is quite natural that the majority of them want to settle
and farm in the South&mdash;the birth place of their parents and usually of
themselves, and the best farming district in the United States, and many
of them do settle there. But quite a few (and the number is rapidly
increasing) after deciding to follow farming as a life work have settled
in the North, or even better have followed Horace Greeley’s famous
advice “Young man, go West”. There they have settled with assurances of
better human treatments and fuller civic rights due all human beings and
American citizens, than they would have received if they had settled in
many parts of the South. On the Pacific Coast they have found farming
conditions more in accord with their special agricultural training than
any place in America with the exception of the South. And whenever any
of those Colored farmers arrived in California, for instance, without
money to buy a few acres of land, they at once hired themselves out to
farmers (without any fear of Southern peonage systems) and in a little
while had saved enough money to strike out for themselves. During the
time they served as farm laborers they were able to get practical and
valuable experience in three ways; through experimenting they got
acquaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span>ed with the Western crops that were new to them; they got
acquainted with the customs and habits of the people, and they had time
to carefully and slowly investigate many sections of the country before
selecting the plot of land and district in which they planned to later
and permanently settle.</p>

<p>The following two quotations are parts of articles written by Governor
Wm. D. Stephens and Secretary of State Frank C. Jordan of California,
and which articles appeared in the April 1, 1920 issue of the California
Free Lance that has since been absorbed into the California Voice. The
reading of these quotations may be of interest to those concerned.</p>

<p>Governor Stephens said&mdash;“Workers are what we need and opportunity was
never so widely open to the Negro as it is today. A very large number of
Colored workers are well fitted for farm labor and it would be better
for them, and a measure of aid to our agricultural interests, if they
could be diverted from the cities into the country. The farm laborer
situation is difficult in this state and steps might well be taken to
shift to the country those Colored men who are residing in large cities,
under conditions unsuited to them. Our Negro workers could themselves
help to solve this problem. Any effort initiated on their part
undoubtedly would meet with active encouragement. Some adaptation to new
conditions would be necessary, but this could easily be brought about
through co-operation between Negro workers and the employing farmers of
our state. I regard this matter of shifting workers who are misplaced in
cities to the farms of our state as a matter of importance, and I invite
the earnest attention of the Negro people to it as one primarily in
their interest as well as being for the best interest of our state.”</p>

<p>Secretary of State, Jordan said in part: “California today has need of
farmers and farm laborers. There is a general alarm felt by persons
acquainted with farming conditions at the shortage of laborers. The
farmer or farm laborer has a comfortable living under health-giving
conditions and the money he makes he can save. He is an independent
producer and plays a most important part in the national welfare. The
California<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span> lands are marvels of richness. Truck gardening, fruit
orchards, wheat and rice fields, cotton lands&mdash;in fact, nearly all farm
culture&mdash;can be found in this State. The important question at present
is, Where are we to find laborers to increase and intensify cultivation?
Immigration from European countries has practically ceased. Mexican
labor is difficult and uncertain. We can only hope for laborers to come
from the more thickly settled parts of the country. The youth of today
needs to be educated not only in the technique of farming, but also in
the advantages of farm life. The prosperity of the nation rests largely
on the agricultural workers. The city dwellers cannot reduce the high
cost of living without the farmer’s co-operation in increased
production. The factory worker depends upon the farmer for food. His
high wages mean little to him unless food is plentiful. Let a young man
consider carefully the opportunities offered by country as well as civic
life&mdash;the sturdy independence, the healthful surroundings, the wholesome
food, of the former&mdash;before he decides what his life work will be.”</p>

<p>Copied below is another article “Land Conditions” that appeared in the
same issue of the Free Lance and which article goes more in detail
regarding the wonderful opportunities of farm life in California&mdash;the
land of not-too-cold nor not-too-hot climate, the land of singing birds,
blooming flowers and golden fruits.</p>

<p>“Probably the greatest opportunity for the race lies in the agricultural
sections of the state. Land at reasonable prices is now being offered by
the Southern Pacific Land Company in sixteen counties in various parts
of the state. While a great deal of this land is available for grazing
purposes, yet there are large tracts awaiting the coming of the man with
the plow, chief among which are sections laying in the beautiful
Antelope Valley, situated in Los Angeles county, which section’s chief
products are alfalfa, grain, fruit and dairying products. The soil of
this valley is somewhat varied. The upper mesas and slopes in the main
valley are decomposed granite of fine texture, with considerable
vegetable humus. In the lower levels there are great deposits of silt
and in every case the soils are light and easy to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span> The water
conditions are all that can be desired, there being quite a deal of
artesian wells, where the water is found at depths varying from 50 to
600 feet. Prices of land in this valley vary from $2 to $10 per acre for
grazing land and from $10 to $71.50 for agricultural lands, with
possibilities of irrigation by pumping.</p>

<p>“In Fresno county, the home of the raisin and the Thompson grapes, there
will be found plenty of opportunities for dairying, fruit and general
farming. This county has now quite a large number of Negro ranchers who
are engaged profitably in various agricultural pursuits. The price of
land in this vicinity ranges from $20 to $143 per acre, with fine
possibilities of irrigation by pumping.</p>

<p>“Nearly all sections in the State of California are filled with
opportunities for men with small capital to engage in various kinds of
farming. While some are impressed by the large ranches, there is ample
opportunities to engage in small farming projects. Land at reasonable
prices and for all purposes can be obtained in the following counties;
Siskiyou, Shasta, Tehama, Butte, Nevada, Yuba, El Dorado, Monterey,
Stanislaus, Fresno, Imperial, Riverside, San Bernardino, Los Angeles,
Kern and Tulare, Recent reports from various sections of the State show
that there are now over 2100 Negroes engaged in agricultural, forestry
and animal husbandry in this State.”</p>

<p>In his annual report of February 1920, Secretary Houston of the
Department of Agriculture pointed out that when both the acreage and
yield per acre are taken into account, the American farmer leads the
world in individual production of crops. He further pointed out that the
aggregate value of all crops raised in the United States for that year
amounted to over fifteen billion dollars. These facts are truly very
encouraging and complimentary to the American farmer and are quite apt
to give him somewhat of a “big-head” until he reads “Social Aspects of
the Decreasing Food Surplus in The United States.” This is a nation-wide
agricultural survey written by one of America’s best authorities on that
subject, Prof. Bernhard Ostrolenk, Director of the National Farm school
at Farm School, Pa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most startling facts and timely warnings he brings out in his
survey is that three million farms in the United States are idle on
account of the American people not developing their unimproved lands. In
writing about the already improved lands and abandoned farms, he says in
part:</p>

<p>“And now we come to the most serious aspect of the agricultural
situation in the United States. For the period of 1900 to 1910 more than
two and a half million people left the country to go to the cities.
Double that figure could safely be assumed to be the true situation from
1910 to 1920. A tragedy is facing the country. Scarcity of food means
dissatisfaction, unrest, riots, mob rule, anarchy.</p>

<p>“Instead of proud boasting when new acquisitions are made in our cities,
new apprehensions for the future food supply should be aroused. Can the
Nation afford to be indifferent to the farmer much longer? We need an
exodus from our congested districts back to the soil and the National
Farm School is ready to lead in that movement. We have proved that it
can be done by taking raw city youths and training them to be successful
farmers. Eighty-seven per cent of our graduates own and operate their
own farms.”</p>

<p>In giving out this advice and information of deep thought and timely
warning, Prof. Ostrolenk has meant for it to apply to and benefit the
great masses of Colored people who are jammed in the cities living in
unsanitary courts and alleys, as he has meant for it to influence the
masses of his own people who have left the country for the cities. And
in putting a last spread on this bread-and-butter subject, the writer
can truthfully say that just as the National Farm School, under the
direction of Prof. Ostrolenk, is taking the lead among other white
agricultural schools in helping to solve this great problem by turning
out such efficient white farmers; so are Hampton Institute, under the
guidance of Dr. Jas. E. Gregg, and Tuskegee Institute, under the
leadership of Dr. Robt. R. Moton, gladly and whole-heartedly joining
hands with the National Farm School in help<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span>ing to bring about this
“Back-to-the-Farm” movement by taking the lead among other Negro
agricultural schools in turning out practically and scientifically
trained Colored farmers.</p>

<p>Young men who wish to take a scientific course in agriculture but
hesitate to do so because they fear their race and color will prevent
them from getting sales for their products, should remember that:</p>

<p>The greatest and only food supplier in the world (the earth) is Colored,
and that no race of people ever attempts to wean itself from sucking its
daily life-giving nourishments from Nature’s nippled breasts just
because those breasts are made of the brown colored dust and dirt from
which all crops must come.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">J</span>UST as the late Dr. Booker T. Washington, founder of the wonderful
school, Tuskegee, was the greatest agricultural and industrial leader of
his race in the United States; so Dr. Robert R. Moton, former educator
at Hampton Institute and present principal of Tusgkee Institute, is
today the foremost leader of the American Colored people in industrial
and agricultural education. And the tireless efforts and uplifting
influence of those two great industrial leaders have either originated
or greatly encouraged and advanced much of the skilled industrial and
intensive agricultural progress made by the Colored people in America
during the past thirty or more years.</p>

<p>But the pioneer and greatest industrial educator of them all was General
Samuel Chapman Armstrong who founded in 1868 the famous Hampton
Institute, which is said to be the leading school of its kind in
America, and among the best in the world. For years not even many
intelligent white and Colored people looked with kindly favor upon
General Armstrong’s then new and strange methods of teaching the head,
the hand and the heart to work together for the highest development of
an individual or a race. People then generally thought that it was
foolish to go to school just to learn the trades or how to work on a
farm, as they had always been taught that schools were places where one
went to learn to study books alone. And that was what nearly every one
wanted to do as it was thought to be a disgrace and dishonor to work
with the hands. But many years had not passed before it was seen and
proved that General Armstrong’s methods were among the most valuable
educational teachings in the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span></p>

<p>And today civilized countries throughout the world are using in their
private, public and government schools vocational and industrial plans
and methods copied after those originated by the far-sighted General
Armstrong and so successfully carried on after his death by Dr. Hollis
Burke Frissell. The unusual beneficial careers of those two life long
friends of Colored peoples stand with the foremost among the careers of
many brave white men and women who have not been ashamed to follow the
footsteps of Christ by unselfishly giving their lives and fortunes for
the encouragement and uplift of an oppressed people. Since the death of
Dr. Frissell a few years ago, Hampton has been under the careful and
progressive leadership of Dr. Jas. E. Gregg who has kept up the high
grade of industrial education he found there. He has also raised the
academic standards to higher planes, in order to better fit his
graduates to more successfully face the advanced educational
requirements they have to meet when going out into the world to wring
success from the opportunities that will constantly come into their
callings.</p>

<p>Below are named a few of the other Colored industrial schools that are
yearly turning out hundreds of skilled and practical auto repairers,
blacksmiths, bricklayers, carpenters, cabinetmakers, domestic science
teachers, dressmakers, engineers, house matrons, machinists, milliners,

<h3>IN THE TRADE SCHOOLS</h3>

<p>While a great many of these schools are kept going through the donations
of money by Northern white individuals and organizations as well as by
the aid of several state appropriations, the majority of them are
supported and run by Colored people themselves. “The African Methodist
Episcopal Church is raising each year about $500,000 for the support of
its twenty colleges and normal schools. The Negro Baptists are giving
support to about 110 colleges and academies.” All together there are
about 175 such schools supported by different Colored church
denominations that raise each year for this purpose about two million
dollars. The properties of these schools thus sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span>ported are worth about
two million five hundred thousand dollars. (Ref: Works Negro Year Book
1918-1919 edition page 286.)</p>

<p>Among the foremost Colored leaders in industrial education are J. B.
Dudley, Winston-Salem, N. C., W. J. Edwards, Snow Hill, Ala., J. M.
Gandy, Petersburg, Va., W. H. Goler, Salisbury, N. C., W. J. Hale,
Nashville, Tenn., J. R. E. Lee, Kansas City, Mo., E. A. Long, Cambria,

<h2><a name="IN_THE_RURAL_SCHOOLS" id="IN_THE_RURAL_SCHOOLS"></a>IN THE RURAL SCHOOLS</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>HEN it is taken into consideration that in 1910, just 47 years after
their freedom was received, there were less than three million
illiterate Negroes in America out of their population of ten million, it
will be seen that the Colored people under most unfavorable
circumstances that have always existed have made very good strides along
educational lines. Rural education among them began as early as 1861
when the first real day school was started near Fortress Monroe, Va., by
the American Missionary Association. That school, which was taught by
Miss Mary S. Peake, a Colored teacher, was the forrunner of Negro rural
school education in the South as well as the pioneer site of the present
Hampton Institute. The movement continued to grow and spread so rapidly
that in 1870 through the assistance of the Freedman’s Bureau, there had
been established in different parts of the South over four thousand
common schools.</p>

<p>While it is true that the majority of the Southern white people apposed
the education of the Negro, there were many of the best thinking among
them who did everything possible to elevate their Colored population.
Together with the hundreds of Northern white people (mostly of the
Quaker and Puritan stocks) who willingly gave their times, fortunes and
in many cases their lives for this cause, different white church
denominations and other organizations spent large sums of money for the
establishment of schools and the support of teachers for the work. As
the outgrowth of that early start there are today in just the Southern
States alone over two million Colored children attending public schools
that are being taught by nearly thirty-seven thousand Colored teachers.
(Ref: Work Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, page 269.)</p>

<p>The greatest encouragement and help that the Southern Colored people
have received in the development of their rural school systems have come
from the Rosenwald Rural School Fund, which was founded by Mr. Julius
Rosenwald, President of the Sears-Roebuck Company of Chicago, Ill. The
following<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span> quotation is an extract from Work’s Negro Year Book,
1918-1919 edition, page 291; “June 12, 1914, Mr. Rosenwald announced
that through the Tuskegee Institute he would provide money to assist in
erecting rural school-houses for Negroes in the South under the
following terms: that the people in the community where a school house
is to be erected shall secure from the public school funds or raise
among themselves an amount equivalent to or larger than that given by
Mr. Rosenwald. It is understood that in no case will the sum given by
Mr. Rosenwald exceed $400 for a one-teacher school and $500 for a
two-teacher school.”</p>

<p>In the April 23, 1921 issue of the Chicago Defender there appeared an
article on the above subject and the following quotation is an extract
from that article: “Nearly 400 rural schools will have been completed
during the year ending July 1 with aid from the Rosenwald fund. Of the
money required to erect these schools our people in the South gave
$500,000, the white people $500,000, various states $800,000 and Mr.
Rosenwald $500,000. All the Rosenwald schools have been put in
operation. Altogether, more than 1,000 schools have been built in the
South with the aid from the Rosenwald fund.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span>”</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span>S Colored people have branched out into more numerous and new business
enterprises, they have found that in order to place their ventures on
foundations that are sure and firm they must learn certain book
knowledge as well as getting actual working experiences in modern
businesses. They have also noticed through observations or experiences
that no matter how well a business may be founded and grounded it will
not continue to succeed unless its detailed operations are carried on by
specially trained and capable workers. Since they, with but few
exceptions, have not been allowed to attend, simply on account of their
Race, white business schools and colleges to receive such preparations,
Colored people have in many of the large cities in America established
their own business schools and colleges. From among the many such
schools the following named are the few that have come under the
writer’s notice during his limited research efforts:</p>

<p>The progressive city of Jacksonville, Fla., has the honor of housing
probably the largest and most modernly equipped private school of this
nature not only in America but in the world among Colored people. The
founder and president of this institution is Prof. R. W. Walker. Through
his patient and un<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span>tiring efforts, unusual business and teaching
abilities, he has built up an enrollment of over one thousand local and
correspondent students in his college that is established in its own
fifty thousand dollar building which is open day and night the year
round for class room work. Aside from its school rooms Walker’s National
Business College has a dormitory for the boarding and lodging of its
out-of-town students.</p>

<p>The Derrick Business School has within the past five years made such
rapid growth and progress under the sound establishment, expert teaching
and sane management of Miss M. J. Derrick that it is now centrally
located in its own building in one of the most exclusive business
sections of Philadelphia, Pa. Miss Derrick has the distinction of being
the only Colored person who owns and manages a business college that
teaches the famous “Boyd’s 30-Day System.” This school also has its own
dormitories for the accommodation of its students living out of the city
and state.</p>

<p>More than ten years ago The Stenographers’ Institute was founded in
Philadelphia, Pa., by Prof. E. T. Duncan. Since that time he has built
up a commercial school of such efficiency that his reputation has
brought to him not only local students but young men and women living in
several other cities and states. The enrollment of his school has become
so large that in the near future he will be compelled to seek new and
larger quarters.</p>

<p>The New York Academy presided over by Prof. R. W. Justice, and
Braithwaite Shorthand School managed by Prof. I. N. Braithwaite are two
business schools in New York City operated by Colored men who are doing
much for the elevation of their race by turning out competent commercial
graduates.</p>

<p>In Chicago, Ill., Prof. M. J. Treadwell’s Commercial Institute and The
Central School of Commerce, of which Prof. W. D. Alimono an expert
bookkeeper and accountant is president, are two Colored business schools
that rank in the first class.</p>

<p>Prof. Chas. A. Brown’s Bruno School of Business, Brooklyn, N. Y., is
also an institution of modern methods and is doing its part in preparing
for future careers stenographers, typewriters, bookkeepers and other
students in various commercial subjects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">C</span>OLORED boys and girls who wish to learn about what some of their race
people have done in big business should read the following and thereby
get encouragement and inspiration.</p>

<p>One of the very first Colored persons (thanks to and honor due Negro
womanhood) to develop an enterprise from a local venture into a
successful national and international commercial standard was the
far-seeing and progressive late Madam C. J. Walker, of Indianapolis and
New York. Starting with a few cents in her pocket but with a full
knowledge of the value of her beauty culture and toilet articles, with
even fuller knowledge of their urgent need among her Colored sisters,
and with the fullest determination and confidence to succeed, Mrs.
Walker within the short period of twelve years made for herself a wealth
of one million dollars. This fortune included a modernly equipped home
in Indianapolis, Ind., a fifty thousand dollar residence in New York
City, and a two hundred fifty thousand dollar mansion at
Irvington-on-the-Hudson, New York. Aside from the numerous and
unrecorded sums of money she gave to both Colored and white charities
during her twelve years of wonderful financial career, Mrs. Walker at
her death bequeathed one hundred thousand dollars to be used in many
charitable ways for the encouragement and uplift of her race. The
business, Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Co., was left to her
daughter, Mrs. Lelia Walker Wilson, whose business abilities handed down
to her from her gifted mother, together with her own original ideas and
efforts have already increased the enterprise. Mrs. Walker’s life of
marvelous success will ever stand out as a clear beacon light to Negro
youths, especially Colored girls. And when the circumstances under which
she labored are taken into just consideration her achievements are
recognized as worthy of being recorded on the best pages of American
history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span></p>

<p>Right on the heels of the above business wonder is the commercial
success of Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Malone, St. Louis, Mo., who are also in
the same line of business. On account of the superior quality of their
goods, the urgent demands for same and the resulting satisfaction they
are giving, their business has increased so rapidly that they were
compelled to recently erect a two hundred fifty thousand dollar
five-story fireproof building. In this structure are housed their
manufacturing plant and office force. The Malones are giving $5,000
toward the Colored Y. M. C. A. Work and various other sums of money for
different lines of betterment for their race, (like the late Madame
Walker and several other wealthy Colored people) show they are with a
Good Samaritan spirit taking altruistic advantages of their unusual
success in business by repeatedly aiding their less fortunate Race
people or humanity in general after they have found the need of such aid
is for a worthy and good cause. So Mr. &amp; Mrs. Malone are today equally
dividing their time between the expansion of their Poro College business
and the encouragement and uplift of their struggling Race.</p>

<p>(Figures extracted from Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, p.
3).</p>

<p>Colored girls who want to go into business for themselves or be
successful in anything but hesitate and hold back because they belong to
the Negro race and are Colored, should remember that:&mdash;The most powerful
thing in the world (the sun) is Colored, and just because Nature has
willed that it must get up every morning and retire every evening with a
red rosy face does not mean that it is blushing with shame or holding
back its leadership in light and energy just because it happens to be a
golden color.</p>

<p>According to an article that appeared in the April 16, 1921 issue of the
Chicago Defender, the Kashmir Chemical Co., and the Nile Queen Co. are
to be formed into one corporation in its own three story building and is
to have a capital of two hundred thousand dollars. This is also a beauty
culture business and is under the hustling and capable leaderships of
its president David Manson and his associates J. D. Bell, George Walker
and C. A. Barnett.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

<p>To be awarded first prize at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the
Jamestown Exposition in 1907 and to be awarded a contract by the United
States Government to supply its army during the World War, is what A. C.
Howard’s shoe polish has accomplished for him. And today the products of
A. C. Howard Shoe Polish Manufacturing Co., New York have become known
on both sides of the oceans.</p>

<p>Because of their unusual business success the writer quotes below from
Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919, pages 360-361, sketches telling about
the accomplishments of three among America’s foremost Colored business
men.</p>

<p>“Boyd, Dr. R. H. Prominent minister in the Baptist denomination. He
established in 1896, the National Baptist Publishing House at Nashville,
Tenn. The printing plant occupies a half block in the business portion
of the city. It pays its employees over $200,000 a year for labor.
According to inventory made by Bradstreet’s Agency, the value of stock,
equipment and property of the concern is about $350,000. Here all the
books and pamphlets needed in the Sunday School and church work of the
Negro Baptists are published. Dr. Boyd is the president of the National
Negro Doll Company, which manufacturers high class Negro dolls.”</p>

<p>“Merrick, John. One of the most successful Negro business men in the
United States. He was born in Clinton, North Carolina, September 7,
1859; died August 6, 1919; was a bricklayer by trade, and later, became
a barber. In 1898 he founded the North Carolina Mutual and Provident
Association, which is one of the strongest Negro insurance companies in
the world. He was one of the wealthiest Negroes in North Carolina. He
owned a large amount of real estate. His monthly rent income was over
$500.”</p>

<p>“Smith, Robert L. Born in Charleston, South Carolina, 1861. Founder of
the Farmer’s Improvement Society of Texas. He graduated from Atlanta
University, and for a time was editor of a paper in Charleston. He then
went to Texas and became a teacher. In 1895 he was elected a member of
the Texas Legislature. Wishing to help the people, he organized in 1890,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span> Farmers’ Improvement Society. The members of the Association now
own over 75,000 acres of land worth considerably over $1,000,000. In
1906 the Society founded an agricultural college at Ladonia, Texas, and
in 1911, they organized a bank at Waco, Texas. The Society also operates
an overall factory at Waco. Under the Auspices of the Society Farmers’
Institutes and fairs are held.”</p>

<p>On account of having detailed knowledge of their enterprises unshaken
determination to succeed, unusual energetic efforts, strict attention to
business, courteous manners to customers, integrity of word, prompt
payment of debts, frugal methods of saving and living within their
means, the late Messrs. McKee, Minton, Smith, Stevens and Trower of
Philadelphia, Pa., in accumulating wealth amounting to millions of
dollars, proved themselves among the most prominent and successful
Colored business men the United States have produced.</p>

<p>As off-springs of people who three hundred years ago were savages in
Africa, and as decendents of people who were in the United States as
slaves for two hundred forty-four years; the American Colored people of
today, less than sixty years from slavery, own and operate seventy-two
Banks. These Banks carry a capital of about two million five hundred
thousand dollars and do an annual business of about thirty-five million
dollars. (Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, page 367).</p>

<p>This marvelous and successful commercial plunge is the most dazzling
banking achievement, as far as history records, ever made in the world
in the same length of time, by a like group of people placed under the
same kind of circumstances. In fact, this most heavily handicapped
business broad-jump has been made with such sudden rapidity, length of
leap and sure-footed landing that financial judges and onlookers of all
races are still dizzy from trying to measure the distance and solve how
it was covered.</p>

<p>Banking critics throughout the country seem to agree in estimating E. C.
Brown, President of Brown and Stevens Bank, Phila., Pa., and Brown
Savings &amp; Banking Co., Norfolk, Va., as the foremost Colored banking
financier of today in America. Aside from having many heavy real estate
holdings in numerous Southern and Northern cities, he is founder and
president of the Quality Amusement Corporation that owns and operates
the Lafayette Theater in New York, the Dunbar Theater, in Phila., Pa.,
and theaters either under construction or contemplation in several other
large cities.</p>

<p>According to an article that appeared on August 13, 1920 in the Dayton
Forum, a Negro paper published by J. H. Rives, Dayton, Ohio, the first
Colored bank in the United States to report resources of over one
million dollars is the Solvent Savings<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span> Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Memphis,
Tenn. Its cashier, B. M. Roddy stated that the bank does business with
twenty-five thousand people. These facts together with a fuller and more
detailed notification were sent to the State Commission on June 30th of
that year. Other Colored banks that separately had resources of over
nine hundred thousand dollars and were expected to reach the million
dollar mark by the end of that year were the Brown Savings &amp; Banking
Co., Norfolk, Va., and the Wage Earners Savings Bank in Savannah, Ga.
The St. Lukes Bank, Richmond, Va., the only institution of its kind
founded and presided over by a Colored woman, Mrs. Maggie L. Walker, has
resources of over five hundred thousand dollars. Other banks that have
gone over the half million dollar mark in resources are, The Mechanics
Bank, Richmond, Va., The Mutual Savings Bank, Portsmouth, Va., and the
Tide Water Bank, Norfolk, Va. Twenty-five Colored banks throughout the
country each have over two hundred fifty thousand dollars in resources.
Colored people have one national bank, not so long established in
Chicago, Ill., The Doughlass National Bank of which P. W. Chavers is
president. The Brown &amp; Stevens Bank, Phila., Pa., and the Binga State
Bank, Chicago, Ill., have both reached the million dollar mark in
resources. The last named bank, of which Jesse Binga is founder and
president, has a capital and surplus of one hundred twenty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>The names in the following list have been handed to the writer as being
just a few from among many such Colored banks in the United States that
are laid on sound foundations, efficiently conducted and fully
recognized for their business integrity, steady financial growth and
broadening moral influences.</p>

<p>“The Allied Bankers’ Corporation will serve as a clearing house for
banks, life and fire insurances companies, manufacturing companies and
for business generally. The enterprise is to be owned by and operated
wholly in the interest of and for the economic development of the Race.”
This quotation is extracted from an article that appeared in the
December 11, 1920 issue of the Chicago Defender. In speaking of this
movement, the article further stated that a group of Colored bankers and
business men were combining in forming and having incorporated a one
million dollar concern to be known as the Allied Bankers and Industrial
Corporation.</p>

<p>“Application for charter has already been made by the following bankers
and business men: L. E. Williams, president Wage Earners’ Savings Bank,
Savannah, Ga.; Harry E. Pace, formerly secretary-treasurer Standard Life
Insurance Company, now president of Pace Phonograph company, New York
City; E. C. Brown, president of Brown &amp; Stevens, bankers, Philadelphia,
Pa., and president Quality Amusement Corporation; John E. Nail, of Nail
&amp; Parker, real estate dealers, New York City; J. S. Jones,

<h2><a name="IN_REAL_ESTATE" id="IN_REAL_ESTATE"></a>IN REAL ESTATE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>ITHIN the past twenty years Colored real estate owners and brokers
throughout the country have made real estate deals running up into
millions of dollars. Some of the heaviest transactions have been made by
Nail &amp; Parker, New York City, Watt Terry, Brocton, Mass., and New York
City, the late P. A. Payton, New York City, A. F. Herndon, Atlanta, Ga.,
R. L. Smith, Waco, Texas, Brown &amp; Stevens, Phila., Pa., Jesse Binga,

<p>According to an article that appeared on page 53 in the May 1920 issue
of The Crisis, Nail &amp; Parker, New York real estate brokers, handle over
a million dollars yearly in rentals and commissions. During the year
1919 Colored people purchased over four million dollars worth of
property in the Harlem section of New York City. But what is said to
have been the largest real estate transaction ever made in the United
States at one time by Colored people was when six large modern De Luxe
Elevator Apartments, that had been constructed on West 141st and 142nd
Street, New York City at a cost of one million five hundred thousand
dollars, were purchased by an organized group of Negro business men.
(Ref. Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, page 3).</p>

<p>Through his personal research work in the following cities, the writer
has been able to uncover from among the many thousands of Colored
business people throughout America, the following unusually successful
business Colored men and women each reputed able to write his or her
personal check for twenty-five thousand dollars; nearly all of them have
saved a fortune of fifty thousand dollars; a large number of them have
reached the one hundred thousand dollar mark; numbers of them have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span> two
hundred fifty thousand dollars to their credits; many of them count
their wealth up to five hundred thousand dollars and quite a few of them
own over a million dollars in cash and property. But in reading this
list let the readers say, as the Queen of Sheba said when she paid a
visit to King Solomon and viewed his wealthy kingdom, “The half has not
been told.” Because the author would remind the reader that all over the
United States there are just as successful and wealthy Colored business
men and women whose names do not appear in this list simply because he
was unable to locate such names during his much handicapped research
work.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>NE of the chief living conditions surrounding the American Colored
people that always stood as a puzzled question to the masses of American
white people was; how did Negroes (considering the low cheating wages,
until the World War, they had always received for their work and the
usually double prices they were made to pay in buying clothes,
furniture, homes, etc.) manage to keep up decent living expenses, save
money and at the same time nourishingly care for their sick and properly
bury their dead? It has never been understood why so few Colored people
have been seen as beggars, and paupers holding up every other street
corner or silently filling the potter fields; while these same places
have always been over-crowded with dependent white people, who in their
prosperous life times had received the highest paid wages and given the
lowest bargain sales. When it is remembered that there is over ninety
million Caucasians in the United States against twelve million Negroes,
even then the percentage of whites in such places is much larger than
that of the blacks. And from the fact that in nearly every large city in
America there are to be found white men and women who own homes and
thousands of dollars and still beg on street corners proves that begging
is easier and comes more natural to white than to Colored people,
because no instance has ever been heard of a Negro street begging when
owning a home or money in a bank.</p>

<p>Now the facts that answer the puzzled question, as to how Negroes have
always been able to “get along” generally under all circumstances, are
the insurance companies, fraternal orders and beneficial societies
founded and operated by Colored people in America. There is nothing in
the world (including death) that the average Colored people dread more
than to face downright poverty, need and beggary, and to prevent such
misfor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span>tunes they become full members in these organizations even from
childhood. For this reason insurance enterprises have proven to be one
of the most congenial occupations, quickest, surest and best paying
business into which Negro business men have so far ventured. On the
other hand the founders and managers of these companies have taken full
advantage of their opportunities to give to the masses of people in
their companies a timely, practical and material helpfulness that is
surpassed by no other group of Colored business leaders.</p>

<p>Philadelphia, Pa., has the honor of having been the home of the first
Negro insurance company, in the United States, which was the American
Insurance Company founded in 1810.</p>

<p>The following named are a few of the many Colored insurance companies
throughout the country that together have policies in force valued at
about sixty million dollars and annually write up insurance amounting to
about forty million dollars.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>N 1784 a Boston Negro, Prince Hall, was granted a warrant from England
to establish the African Lodge, No. 459 of the Masons; and in 1843 Peter
Ogden, a Colored organizer in New York, secured a charter from England
to set up the Philomathean Lodge No. 646 of the Odd Fellows. Since then
the Knights of Pythias, the True Reformers, The Elks, the Grand United
Order of Galilean Fishermen, the National Order of Mosaic Templars, the
Independent Order of St. Luke and the Grand United Order of Tents (which
last named order is one of the best managed and most progressive
societies organized and run entirely by women) have been established and
become nationally known. The following is quoted from Work’s Negro Year
Book, 1918-1919 edition, page 457:</p>

<div class="blockquot4"><p>“There are over sixty secret and fraternal organizations among
Negroes in the United States of a more or less national scope. It
is estimated that they have a total membership of about 2,000,000.
Large sums of money have come into the treasuries of the various
secret organizations. The Knights of Pythias have collected over
$1,000,000 for endowment. There is over $50,000 in the Grand Lodge
treasury. A considerable part of the money collected by the orders
has been permanently invested. It is estimated that the Masons have
about $1,000,000 worth of property; the Odd Fellows $2,000,000; and
the Pythians $2,500,000. It is probable that altogether the Negro
secret societies in the United States own $20,000,000 worth of
property. The Odd Fellows have in New Orleans, a building that cost
$36,000, and in Atlanta and Philadelphia, buildings that have cost
$100,000 each. In Indianapolis, New Orleans and Chicago, Knights of
Pythias own buildings each worth from $30,000 to $100,000. The
Negro secret societies are paying attention to the improving of the
health of their members. The Supreme Lodge of the Knights of
Pythias has erected a sanitarium at Hot Springs, Arkansas; the
Mosaic Templars and other societies have established health
bureaus.”</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A.</span> B. MACON was the first Negro in the United States to be admitted
before the bar to practice law, which occured in Massachusetts in 1845.
Since he thus blazed such a path through the law fields of America,
Colored men and women have continued to follow that pathway until today
there are about one thousand Colored lawyers practicing in different
parts of the United States. And they are making splendid records before
judge benches and jury boxes by legally understanding, plainly
interpreting, and loyally defending the laws of this land.</p>

<p>When Miss Charlotte Ray, as the first Colored woman lawyer in America,
graduated from Howard University in 1872, she was fully justified in
lightly and nimbly stepping off the campus of her Alma Mata with her
heart excitedly beating in her eagerness to at once secure a case and
descend upon some court room where she could try out her logical,
convincing and persuasive pleadings.</p>

<p>Since Miss Ray’s graduation as a lawyer, it is found that while many,
say twenty-five or thirty Colored women in the United States have up to
the present time secured their degree of LL. B., few of them are today
engaged in active law practice. Among this number the writer has only
been able to locate the following who are today practicing law in this
country: Attorneys Violette N. Anderson, Chicago, Ill., Carolyn Hall
Mason and Marie Nadras, Washington, D.C. and Mrs. Jessica Morris, wife
of Edward H. Morris, the foremost practicing Colored attorney in
Chicago, is a graduate of the 1920 law class of Northwestern University
and during the month of July 1921 successfully passed her State Bar
Examination. At this writing she had not taken up active practice.
Attorney Violette N. Anderson, 145 No. Clark Street, Chicago, Ill., is
very anxious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span> has for quite a while been trying to locate and get
into communication with every Colored woman lawyer in the United States,
in order to form a National Association.</p>

<p>One of the many up-lifting acts performed for Colored people by Charles
Sumner, that fearless Abolitionist and loyal friend to the Negro race,
was to make it possible in 1865 for John Rock to be admitted as the
first Negro to practice law before the United States Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The first Negro to hold a city judgeship in the United States was M.
Wistar Gibbs, who in 1873 was elected to that responsible and dignified
position in Little Rock, Ark. This learned lawyer also at different
times filled such national positions as Register of the U. S. Land
Office in Arkansas and United States Consul to the Island of Madagascar.</p>

<p>(Ref. Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition pgs. 171-283.)</p>

<p>Without doubt the best known and most popular Colored lawyer in the
United States today is Judge Robt. H. Terrell, who as Municipal Judge
for many years repeatedly appointed in Washington, D.C., by both
Republican and Democratic Presidents, has won and held the good-will and
respect of his white associates because of his all-round judical wisdom
and logical decisions in the court room. By his pleasant and friendly
manners as well as loyalty and pride in his Race, Judge Terrell has also
endeared himself in the hearts of the great masses of Colored people in
all parts of the country where he has traveled and spoken.</p>

<p>Many Negro lawyers in different parts of the country have won national
recognitions and reputations by their legal fights before city or state
legislative bodies for equal citizenship rights and protection of
Colored citizens in the United States. The following are among those
whose names come to the writer’s mind at this moment:</p>

<p>Hon. Harry C. Smith, while a member of the Ohio Legislature, drew up an
Anti-lynching Bill and introduced it into that body in 1894 and
re-introduced it in 1896 when it was enacted into a law, which has been
upheld on several occasions by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span> Supreme Court of Ohio. This law is
one of the best pieces of legislature of such nature enacted by any
state in the Union, and other States that have formed such laws have
modeled them after the Ohio measure. Attorney Smith was also the sponsor
of the present Ohio Civil Rights Law.</p>

<p>Hon. Robt. R. Jackson is the father of the Illinois Civil Rights Bill
that went through the Illinois General Assembly while he was a member of
it. It has been through his wisdom and untiring efforts that several
other city and state bills have been drawn up and passed as laws for the
benefit of the Colored people in Illinois.</p>

<p>Hon. H. J. Copehart with the assistance of Hon. T. G. Nutter, both
members of the W. Va. Legislature, has succeeded in putting through the
House and Senate of that state one of the severest anti-lynching bills
so far passed by any state legislative body. Representative Nutter,
among the numerous measures he has had passed, is producer of the bills
that were passed and enacted into laws to establish an industrial school
for Colored boys and an industrial home for Colored girls in W. Va.</p>

<p>Hon. F. M. Roberts is the first and only Negro serving as a State
Assemblyman in the California Legislature. Since he was first elected in
1918 and re-elected in 1920, he has been the means of having put through
several bills that have been enacted into laws for the welfare of
Negroes in California.</p>

<p>Hon. J. C. Asbury, a Pennsylvania Representative, is father of the Equal
Civil Rights Bill that was recently killed in the Pennsylvania State
Senate after having passed through the House. Legislator Asbury made
such a well prepared legal fight for the passage of his bill that even
those who fought against it were compelled to admire the flawlessness of
the measure and the intelligent and manly contest by its sponsor.</p>

<p>Many other notable Negro lawyers too numerous to mention here have taken
courageous and successful stands in using their legal abilities along
the above lines as well as defending riot victims of their race in
different parts of the country. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span> following names are of other

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">S</span>TARTING out in 1827, when the first Colored newspaper in the United
States, The Freedmen’s Journal was published in New York City by John B.
Russwurm, the number of Negro journals have so increased until today
there are between two and three hundred secular weekly and two daily
newspapers published in the United States by Colored people. (Ref.;
Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, pgs. 170-461).</p>

<p>The honor of being acclaimed dean of today in Negro newspaper editorial
work falls upon the venerable shoulders of the “Grand Old Scribe,” T.
Thomas Fortune, once editor of the famous New York Age and still a
widely read contributor to some of the leading newspapers and magazines
in the country. This pioneer journalist (who was at one time “right hand
man” to the great white journalist, Chas. A. Dana, who bought and
revived the moribund New York Sun into one of the greatest papers in
America) was doing newspaper work as far back as 1879 on the New York
Globe, a leading white paper. Around that time Fortune was also the
trusted friend and valuable current informer and adviser of such capable
and fearless leaders as H. P. Brooks, J. W. Cromwell, C. N. Otey and
Frederick Douglass, who was termed by Mr. Fortune as “The lion of them
all.”</p>

<p>The younger Colored newspaper men of today are all well acquainted with
the history of Fred Douglass’ fighting abolition paper, “The North Star”
that he first published at Rochester, N. Y., in 1847 and later renamed
it “Fred Douglass’ Paper”, which in 1860 he absorbed into “Douglass
Monthly” a magazine he first began to publish in 1858.</p>

<p>There are yet living today many older men and women who can vividly
recall from personal observation how that great orator, reformer,
statesman and journalist could in a column on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span> his editorial page wield
a pungent pen against the enemy of his race so forcefully by turning out
polished and gentlemanly invective articles that neither feared nor
spared but manfully denounced and exposed those who held or upheld
slavery. And in another column on that same editorial page he could just
as ably use an unsurpassed tactful ability in penning mutual and
grateful paragraphs to the loyal friends of his race, who were at once
more strongly allied to his side; or, he could in a third column just as
diplomatically word a concilatory open-letter to the half-decided whites
who, after thoroughly reading and thoughtfully thinking over his
heart-rending and convincing sentences were usually completely persuaded
to friendly join his cause for the freedom of his people. And the
increasing denouncements and criticisms that are read in the Northern
white press against the present barbarous peonage systems carried on in
the South today are but very very faint echoes of the clarion and
stenotorian thunderings that electrically flashed, roared and rumbled
seventy years ago throughout the world from the columns of “The North
Star” or from the actual lips of Fred Douglass while lecturing in
England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales against the real slavery that the
South was then savagely carrying on with his race.</p>

<p>Another pioneer in this line of work is Phil H. Brown of Kentucky, who
has been following newspaper writing for over thirty years. Aside from
being an editor on daily and weekly journals, he has been connected with
the Chicago Daily News, The New York Journal and the New York Sun all
white papers. He has also written articles for Frank Leslie’s New York
publications and the humorous magazines “Judge”. For three national
campaigns Mr. Brown has ably directed the newspaper publicity among
American Colored people for the Republican National Committee. He has
just been appointed under President Harding’s administration as
Commissioner of Conciliation in the Department of Labor.</p>

<p>Another seasoned scribe of the “old school” who is yet, after fifty
years of active newspaper work, able to give the “new school” young
reporters many valuable pointers, as to the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span> kind of punch
(sparkling but not wet) to put into their night write-ups, is the spry
and jolly Civil War veteran, Sergeant Ralph Hawkins.</p>

<p>Charles Stewart, as a scribe of the first order, has put more than two
score years in this field in gathering news for some of the leading
white and Colored papers of the country. His abilities as a good mixer,
keen observer, good reasoner and an expert shorthand writer enabled him
years ago by using his clever disguises to get the inside secret and
puzzling facts to make numerous big newspaper write-ups on important and
vital events that had not been unearthed, after repeated trials, by,
some of the country’s most expert white newspaper reporters.</p>

<p>The late Richard W. Thompson was a man of wide newspaper experience and
knowledge. He was at different times on the editorial staffs of the
Washington Colored American and the Indianapolis World. He was the
founder of a newspaper bureau in Washington, D.C. from where he sent out
his famous letters to Colored papers throughout the country. He was
without doubt one of the hardest workers Colored journalism has ever
had. On more than one occasion the writer has seen Mr. Thompson take
down notes all day and sit up that entire night getting out press
releases for the next day.</p>

<p>In the deanship of newspaper work with T. T. Fortune is A. J. Murphy,
editor of his nationally known Afro-American published in Baltimore, Md.
Newspaper men who come in contact with Mr. Murphy are greatly encouraged
and benefited as the results of his unusual journalistic abilities and
experience extending over scores of years.</p>

<p>Ralph W. Tyler, World War newspaper writer and now on the editorial
staff of the Cleveland Advocate, and L. T. Thompson World War Historian,
are among the foremost newspaper men in the Race today. To them, on
account of their bravery to face all kinds of perils and unselfish
expending of tireless efforts to get true facts first-hand, goes much of
the honor or the gathering and compiling of the data pertaining to the
accurate history of the American Colored soldiers and sailors in the
World War.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span></p>

<p>Cleveland G. Allen, one of the best known of the younger newspaper men
of the race, is making journalism his profession. Aside from being the
only Negro reporter in 1911 at the Ecumenical Conference at Toronto,
Canada, and acting as traveling newspaperman with the late Bishop
Alexander Walters, he was for many years one of Dr. Booker T.
Washington’s Northern publicity men. It was mainly through his efforts
that the name of a Negro, Frederick Douglass, was first brought before
the Hall of Fame, and through his newspaper work an investigation was
conducted against the discriminations of Colored sailors in the U. S.
Navy. He has written a great deal for daily newspapers of New York and
the entire country on the Negro question and at one time conducted a
National News Bureau for the Negro Press. Having studied in Union High
School, Greenville, S. C.; in the New York Evening High School three
years where he won oratorical honors; two years of journalism in New
York University; studying at the Angelus Academy of Music where he won a
scholarship; and at present taking up special work at Columbia
University: Mr. Allen, on account of the above preparations and
experiences, is well fitted to hold his present positions as a member on
the editorial staff of “Home News” a large white newspaper in New York,
and as an appointed lecturer on Negro Music for the Board of Education
in New York City. He has a brother, Henry Allen, who is also a prominent
newspaperman at Stamford, Conn.</p>

<p>Among America’s foremost Colored women newspaper writers of today is
Frances Berry Coston of Indianapolis, Ind. Her chief work is in feature
articles and stories. Having graduated from Berea College; from the
Chicago University post-graduate course in literature and languages;
from the Pulitzer School of Journalism at Columbia University and from
the celebrated Harvard Starred Course in English, (given primarily for
authors and journalists) Mrs. Coston is well prepared and fully capable
to hold her present position. She is Literary Correspondent for the
Indianapolis News, one of the largest and most influential white
dailies, not only in the West, but throughout the country. Because of
her unusual efficiency and versatile abilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span> as a writer, she is
permitted by the editorial staff to turn out articles on any subject or
along any literary line she may desire. Mrs. Coston is given all the
work she can do on the literary page of this paper, and in connection
with the Book Review Department of the News, she is allowed to make her
own selections from the literary editor’s desk.</p>

<p>While still in his teens during the early nineties, Jas. A. Jackson of
Bellefonte, Pa., started his newspaper career with the Daily News, a
white newspaper published in his home town. Since that time he has
developed to such a high standard until today he stands among the most
widely known feature short story Colored and white writers of today. His
stories have frequently appeared on the magazine pages of the Sunday
editions of the New York Sun and the New York Herald. On account of his
very wide travels throughout the United States and abroad, he has become
acquainted with many of the most prominent newspapermen on both sides of
the ocean. With several of these writers and authors he has joined in
writing articles for some of America’s most popular magazines as well as
noted newspapers published in European countries. In 1912 he wrote a
lengthy article, “The Negro At Large” and in 1918 he wrote “The
Underlying Cause of Race Riots.” These masterpieces of journalism were
greatly quoted by many newspapers and magazines, after the articles had
first appeared in the New York Globe. Mr. Jackson’s latest literary step
was made when he recently accepted a membership on the editorial staff
of “The Billboard”, as Dramatic Reviewer. This is an amusement weekly
(white) publication that was founded in New York many years ago and
today has a circulation of over two hundred thousand copies a week.</p>

<p>The two daily newspapers run by Colored people in the United States are
W. T. Andrews’ Baltimore Herald that is published in Baltimore, Md., and
Arthur Craig’s The Daily Star which is published in New York City where
it has a daily circulation of over forty thousand copies.</p>

<p>Among the Colored newspapers in the United States, Robt. S. Abbott’s
Chicago Defender (World’s Greatest Weekly) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span> recognized as having the
largest circulation. This newspaper recently moved into its own two
hundred fifty thousand dollar, three-story, modern building that
contains a print shop, four linotype machines, and four-deck Goss
straight-line press.</p>

<p>“The late Christopher James Perry was born in Baltimore, Md., September
11, 1854. At an early age he went to Philadelphia, where he obtained
employment and became a student of the public night school. In 1884,
after some of his writings had been published, he became a special
writer for the Sunday Mirror, of Philadelphia, to report the activities
of the Negroes of the city. He later started the Philadelphia Tribune, a
Negro weekly, which has been published for 36 years. This newspaper is
published in the Tribune Building and has a $100,000 plant of which Mr.
Perry was the sole owner.” Quoted from the Sept. 1921 issue of the
Crisis:</p>

<p>Another one of the best nationally known Colored papers that is doing
business in its own establishment that is completely equipped with the
most modern newspaper machinery is Fred R. Moore’s New York Age. This
paper is one of the oldest and most popular in the field, and is also a
weekly issue. There are other Colored newspapers throughout the country
that are in their own modernly equipped establishments.</p>

<p>Those named in the following listed cities are just a few of the Colored
newspapers that, on account of their up-to-date instructive-news, all
round influence for encouragement and inspiration and constant race
loyalty, have won race leading reputations of the first quality for
themselves and their editors not only in their own cities but throughout
and beyond their own states:</p>

<h3>Religious Papers</h3>

<p>Among the three score and more religious Colored newspapers in America,
R. E. Jones’ Southwestern Christian Advocate of New Orleans, La., R. R.
Wright’s Christian Recorder of Phila., Pa. J. D. Crenshaw’s National
Baptist Voice of Nashville, Tenn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span> and N. S. Epps’ Baptist Herald of New
York City are some of the most nationally known and widely circulated.</p>

<h3>National Negro Press Association</h3>

<p>The National Negro Press Association, of which J. Finley Wilson is
president, is an organization among Colored newspaper editors for the
purpose of uniting them in mutual friendships and understanding. At
their annual meetings they become better acquainted and exchange their
different ideas in order to become better news informers and stronger
champions through their organs for justice to their race.</p>

<h3>The Associated Negro Press</h3>

<p>Although not yet three years old, the Associated Negro Press, of which
N. D. Brascher of Chicago, Ill., is editor-in-chief, is already exerting
a wonderful influence in the field of Negro journalism and is doing
excellent work in so efficiently gathering and so promptly releasing to
its newspaper members the most vital current events of the day.</p>

<p>The noble and tireless efforts of the Colored editors, in trying to help
convert the prejudiced white people of the United States from their
unjust hatred, discrimination and cruelties upon the Negro race just
because of its progress, are each day being more ably backed up by the
American white press. As the writer has said in the chapter dealing with
church work, white papers throughout the country are increasing in
numbers in making their editorials stronger and stronger in justly
denouncing mob rule, its results and future reaction upon these United
States. This sentiment in the white press is increasing and spreading so
rapidly that even white papers in different parts of the South are
fearlessly joining this movement for right.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1918 a Southern paper, the San Antonio Express of Texas
set aside a fund of one hundred thousand dollars to be used in helping
to put down lynching in the United States. This money is to be used to
pay rewards for the arrest and conviction of all persons taking part in
lynchings. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span> Texas white papers, the Houston Post and the Austin
American have on different occasions come out strongly in contending for
fair treatment and justice to the Colored people.</p>

<p>With reference to the jury which heard the evidence in the peonage trial
of John S. Williams, Georgia white planter, accused of killing eleven
Negro farm hands, and on trial for the slaying of one of them, and which
jury brought in a verdict of guilty, with life sentence, but urged
“mercy” on the court; the following editorial by Thomas W. Loveless
appeared in a Georgia white paper, The Enquirer-Sun, according to an
article that came out in the April 16, 1921 issue of the Chicago
Defender:</p>

<p>“A Newton county jury has tried John S. Williams, the Jasper county
multimurderer, found him guilty, and recommended him to the mercy of the
court. By what process of reasoning the jury arrived at this form of
verdict is difficult if not well nigh impossible to imagine. This is, if
we try to analyze it by any ‘process of reasoning’, but if we brush
aside all subterfuge and hypocrisy and tell the plain truth about it,
the verdict&mdash;as great a travesty of justice as it is&mdash;is not so
difficult to understand.</p>

<p>“And this plain truth is we have not yet reached that stage of grace, or
of justice, in Georgia where we ‘hang a white man for killing a nigger’,
as the expression is and has long been ...</p>

<p>“However, the owner and operator of this Georgia ‘murder farm’ escapes
with his own life&mdash;a penitentiary sentence&mdash;and perhaps a pardon later
on if he lives long enough and his family can bring enough influence to
bear.</p>

<p>“Thus do we again ‘advertise Georgia.’ God help her.”</p>

<p>Referring to the recent Tulsa, Oklahoma race riot, in which the mob
destroyed forty-four blocks of Negro property, the following extracts
are parts of an editorial that appeared in the July 7, 1921 issue of a
white newspaper, The National Tribune of Washington, D.C.</p>

<h3>“The Burning Disgrace of ‘Race Riot’<span class="lftspc">”</span>.</h3>

<p>“As we have said before, there is a strong element in Tulsa coming from
the renegade whites who fled out of the reach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span> justice to start a
so-called “race riot” on any pretext. The more that the situation is
studied the less provocation there was for such an outrage. The
absurdity of the white girl’s story that she had been insulted by a
negro boy was apparent on its face. It is said her reputation was not of
the best and no one apparently stopped to think of the impossibility of
such an outrage in the most public place in a city of 100,000 people.
The elevator which she was running was in the most conspicuous part of
the building.</p>

<p>“The riot was made possible by the worthlessness of the police and
judiciary. As usual in a place of such sudden rise to greatness as
Tulsa, the vicious elements have entirely too large a control of the
municipal authorities. The houses of ill-fame, gambling joints,
bootleggers, and other criminals have too much to say as to the
selection of officials. For 14 years Tulsa has been in the absolute
control of this element. The better class of people were too much
absorbed making the easy money possible there to bother themselves and
give up any time to politics.</p>

<p>“Quite a number of negroes have made fortunes in Tulsa and they became
the special objects of the mob. One colored man owned and operated a
printing plant with $25,000 of printing machinery in it. It was assailed
and burned to the ground by a mob led by a man who had been working a
linotype at a salary of $48 a week. Of course, this linotype man
professed to be a “perfect Southern gentleman” and superior to a negro,
although he degraded himself by working for him at good wages. Dr. A. C.
Jackson, a colored physician, who was called by competent authorities
the most able negro surgeon in America, was marked for the wrath of the
mob because he owned $100,000 worth of property. He tried to fight
against the mob and surrendered under a pledge of protection, but was
murdered on his way to jail.” ...</p>

<p>The above are but a few of the many such editorials that have recently
come under the notice of the writer, and if white editors who run out
such editorials could just mingle among the masses of both races where
their papers are read and listen to the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span>ments being made, they would
be amazed to note the influence for good that such writings are
exerting. And if now in this critical period of racial unrest, the
majority of white editors through this land together with the white
clergy will take such stands for law and order, the race prejudice in
this country will be checked before its barbarism pulls the United
States down, down, down to the very lowest and most despised race among
all nations and countries&mdash;civilized and uncivilized. For this unjust
public sentiment can only be checked and changed by the right kind of
influences starting from the white pulpits and printing rooms. The
frequent clashings of swords cannot force about such a change, but the
constant exchange of reasoning sermons and editorials can persuade such
a change to come about.</p>

<p>If it is the fear of losing their congregations and churches that
prevents so many white ministers from taking such a stand; then the way
to be outspoken (instead of silent) against mob sins and crimes, and
still keep “Mrs. Wolf” from grinning at them through their parsonage
windows, is for all of them to become outspoken. And as their people
must continue to have churches and be preached to, those ministers would
still hold their pulpits as they would then be the only kind of
preachers (outspoken) to listen to.</p>

<p>If it is the fear of losing their subscribers and seeing their papers go
into the waste baskets that keeps so many white editors from taking such
a rightful stand; then the way to keep and increase their subscribers
and at the same time keep “Mr. Wolf” from sniffing around the kitchen
doors, is for all editors to begin to use the “Golden (printer’s
guiding) Rule” to measure out their editorials on the Race questions. As
their people must have newspapers in order to learn what is going on in
the world, rather than get no papers they would buy the only kind (the
fair and just) that would then be printed. And in using the above
methods in bringing about brotherhood and Christlike feelings between
the two races, no one would be the loser, but all would be the gainers.</p>

<p>As another witness and proof that courageously standing for right and
fearlessly denouncing wrong through their convincing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span> columns does not
weaken but eventually strengthens and increases the influence of such
white periodicals; the writer quotes below in part an editorial that
appeared in the September 14, 1921 issue of The Nation, a world-famed
white magazine that has been successfully published in New York for over
fifty years during all which time its publication has continued to grow
and spread as the results of just such Golden Rule editorials as the
following:</p>

<p>“The daughter of Mr. J. B. Webb, “prominent in financial and social
circles,” chose to marry a groom, her sister having previously married a
policeman.... The newspapers sent around special reporters in
battalions. Then up spoke Mr. Webb: “It’s rotten, that’s what I call
it&mdash;rotten! To tear a person’s life to shreds like this, and bring up
for the public eye the affairs of one poor little girl.” To which we say
a hearty Amen. But more rotten than this outrageous violation of
individual rights by the press is the careless or malicious zest with
which certain papers, especially in the South, publish stories from
depraved or irresponsible white women accusing some black man of a more
or less grave offense against them. Every newspaperman knows that just
such a story started the Tulsa riots, as well as those in Washington and
in Omaha. Yet here we find on the front pages of the Memphis Commercial
Appeal two circumstantial stories of attack by Negroes on white women.
Both of them were false, as the newspaper itself admitted less
conspicuously next day. This sort of thing is all too common and not
every city has a paper as bold as the Memphis Press in denouncing it. It
is high time for a renascence of ethical standards in newsgathering.”</p>

<h3>In Magazine Writing</h3>

<p>Just as Dr. W. E. B. DuBois is recognized as the foremost magazine
writer in the Negro race, not only in America but throughout the world;
it is said he has also made The Crisis Magazine, of which he is
editor-in-chief, the widest read Colored magazine of its kind not only
in the Western but also in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is estimated that
this magazine is read each month by nearly four hundred thousand
people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span></p>

<p>Among lettered Colored women, Miss Jessie R. Fauset, a graduate of
Cornell where she was made a member of the Phi Betta Kappa Fraternity,
later becoming a teacher of French and Latin in the M Street High
School, Washington, D.C., and at present Literary Editor of the The
Crisis Magazine, is today recognized by the best critics as a leading
and most versatile magazine writer.</p>

<p>Such wise, timely and meatful articles as “Race Consciousness,” “Heart
Talk,” “Representation of the American Woman,” “World Brotherhood,” “Oil
Upon Troubled Waters” are among the many writings that have stamped Miss
H. Georgiana Whyte, editor of the Women’s Department of The Favorite
Magazine, as one of the most forceful and helpful magazine writers among
Colored women.</p>

<p>Aside from long ago proving himself as one of the ablest Colored
newspaper editors in the country, Attorney Robt. L. Vann of Pittsburgh,
Pa., has shown by the high quality of his Competitor Magazine that as a
writer in this field he is second to none.</p>

<p>The cheerfulness and life that Editor Fenton Johnson puts into his
Favorite Magazine explains why it is having such a rapid growth and has
become a sure-enough favorite with the Colored readers, not only in its
home city of Chicago but throughout the country.</p>

<p>The inspiring snap that Editor Willis N. Huggins throws into his UpReach
Magazine accounts for it being so popular, especially with the younger
and progressive element among the Colored readers who are always
benefited by such well chosen and written articles.</p>

<p>The exceptional ability to so vividly portray human nature from the
viewpoints of both races when building up stories is one of the secrets
that is the cause of Editor Aubery Bowser’s Rainbow Magazine being
sought after by all readers who want to learn and understand the inside
life situations as they really exist when the two races come in close
contact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span></p>

<p>Except those people who personally go through the tedious processes of a
similar work, no one is able to fully realize and appreciate the value
of the up-to-date culled, methodically complied, instructively built-up
and tastily arranged matter that Miss Madeline G. Allison presents each
month in The Crisis: under the heading “The Horizon.” In monthly
compiling the tremendous new store of varied and far-reaching data her
department contains, Miss Allison is doing a grand and unique piece of
literary writing the workmanship and quality of which any magazine of
any race would be proud to carry.</p>

<p>As the results of the deep thinking and outspoken opinions that get down
to the very core and essence of the subjects handled by them, Editors
Owens and Chandler, through the medium of their magazine The Messenger
are fast mounting top rungs in their profession and at the same time
attracting the wide attentions of well-versed and seasoned newspaper and
magazine people in both races.</p>

<p>Although it has not been founded very long, the Method Magazine, edited
by F. H. Hallion, of Richmond, Va., is attracting wide attention on
account of its instructive and helpful articles pertaining to business
relations in their many fields of activities.</p>

<p>The Brownies’ Book, edited by W. E. B. DuBois, &amp; A. G. Dill of New York
City, N. Y., is something entirely new in the field of Negro journalism.
It is, “A monthly magazine for children which attempts to bring to them:
The best in pictures and stories of Negro life. The life and deeds of
famous men and women of the Negro race. The current events of the world
told in beautiful language which children can understand.”</p>

<p>In going out of the way to thoughtfully assert that the Brownies’ Book
should be in every Negro home where there are children; the writer
expresses such a sentiment, not because of being more partial to this
certain magazine and its editors than to other magazines and their
editors, but, because he is ever proud to admit that he is really cranky
partial to any Negro history no matter under what covers it may appear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span>
Especially is this true when such history is written (as in the
Brownies’ Book) in plain, easy, truthful and interesting English that
makes first and lasting impressions upon young and tender Negro minds
before they are indelibly imprinted and permanently poisoned by the
devilish trash contained in blood-thirsty, underworld, dime novels so
youthfully secured and greedily read by unwatched and idle-minded
children of all races.</p>

<p>Although it is not a monthly magazine but a quarterly journal, The
Journal of Negro History, edited by Carter G. Woodson of Washington,
D.C. is a nationally known publication of instruction, encouragement and
inspiration for the American Colored people, of matured years who wish
to learn their Race history.</p>

<p>Monroe N. Work’s marvelously compiled Negro Year Book is conceded to be
the greatest compact work of literary science ever produced by an
American Negro. What the World Almanac is to the Caucasian Race, The
Negro Year Book is to the Negro Race. The following quotation is what a
leading white newspaper, The New York Sun, commented on this masterpiece
of literature: “Interesting and important is the array of facts relating
to the Negro contained in the Negro Year Book. The book is a perfect
encyclopedia of achievements by Negroes in all ranks of life, of the
history of the race in the United States, of Legislative enactments
relating to them, of activity in all branches, particularly education.
The book is indispensable to all who have to deal with any phase of the
Negro question.”</p>

<p>Some names in above list are extracts from Negro Year Book, 1918-1919
edition, (Page 465).</p>

<p>As a successful magazine essay prize writer, Isaac Fisher, of Nashville,
Tenn., is recognized today as the foremost in the Negro race. The
following quotation is part of an article that appeared in the July 9,
1921 issue of the Chicago Defender:</p>

<p>“The third prize of $75, offered by the Metropolitan Magazine of New
York in its contest for writers on the subject, “Can We Keep Peace with
Japan,” was won by Isaac Fisher, editor of the Fisk University News,
according to an announcement made<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span> in the August issue of the magazine
just released....</p>

<p>“Among the prizes he has won in the past through his writings are first
prize of $500 offered by Everybody’s Magazine; first prize of $100
offered by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; first prize of $50 offered for
the best digest of the merits of the money-weight scales; second prize
of $400 offered by Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx’ executive committee of
Chicago; second prize of $100 offered by the Manufacturers’ Record of
Baltimore.</p>

<p>“Those who know Mr. Fisher’s records are aware that these are but a few
of the prizes he has won in competition with the best minds of the
country. It will be remembered that he won the first prize of $500 in
Everybody’s Magazine contest in competition with 900 writers, including
some of the best legal and professional men of the country.”</p>

<p>In summing up, the leading Colored short-story writers of today who are
known throughout the country as standing contributors to newspapers and
magazines are Frances Coston Berry, Indianapolis, Ind., Aubrey Bowser,

<h3>Noted Colored Statisticians</h3>

<p>Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, Harvard graduate, Editor of The Crisis and The
Brownies’ Book, New York City, and recognized as the leading Negro
Sociologist in the world, is in possession of more authentic data
covering the social life of the American Colored people than any other
member of the race.</p>

<p>Dr. Geo. E. Haynes, Columbia graduate, U. S. Director of Negro Economics
during the World War, and Dr. R. R. Wright Jr., graduate of the
University of Pa., and editor of the Christian Recorder, Phila., Pa.,
are the two leading American Colored authorities on economic data
relative to the all-round labor, industrial and living conditions of the
Colored people in America.</p>

<p>Prof. W. T. B. Williams, Harvard graduate, Vice-Principal of Tuskegee
Institute and Field Agent for the Jeanes and Slater Funds, is estimated
to have on his “finger tips” more convincing and reliable facts and
figures pertaining to the purposes, needs kinds and grades of work done
and results obtained in Negro universites, colleges, industrial normal
schools and rural county schools than any educator in America.</p>

<p>Prof. Monroe N. Work, a University of Chicago graduate, editor of the
Negro Year Book and Director of Department Records and Research,
Tuskegee Institute, Ala., is the foremost Negro not only in America, but
throughout the world, who has in his possession the greatest amount of
authentic statistics covering the all-round past and present activities
of the Colored people in the United States of America.</p>

<h3>Colored Orators and Lecturers</h3>

<p>Some of the foremost Colored orators and lecturers who are most
frequently on the platform before the American public today are J. W. E.
Bowen, Atlanta, Ga., W. E. B. DuBois, New York City, N. Y., Geo. E.
Haynes, Washington, D.C., Eva D. Bowles, New York City., Hallie Q.
Brown, Wilberforce, Ohio, E. K. Jones, Jas. Weldon Johnson, New York
City, N. Y., Mordecai Johnson, Charleston, W. Va., Kelly Miller,
Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span> D.C., Chas. S. Morris, Jr., Norfolk, Va., J. E. Moorland,
New York, N. Y., R. R. Moton, Tuskegee, Ala., Wm. Pickens, New York
City, N. Y., C. V. Roman, Nashville, Tenn., Roscoe C. Simmons,
Louisville, Ky., Mary C. Terrell, Washington, D. C., Wm. M. Trotter,
Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>Now, if after reading through the foregoing pages of inspiration,
regarding the successes of Negro writers, some Colored girls and boys
should still lack courage, because of their color and race, to throw
their talents into such literary avenues, they should remember that:&mdash;</p>

<p>The most important thing about a newspaper, magazine or book is not its
white pages, (because such pages can be and often are colored) but the
most important thing in such a publication is its print of jet black
letters and words. But if those genuine Ethiopian letters refused, just
because of their color, to mingle with and make lasting impressions upon
the fair Caucasian pages of newspapers, magazines and books; why my
discouraged young friends, there would be no fields nor meadows of
journalism in which white people could even enter to frolic in the games
of “pen and pencil pushing.”</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">F</span>OR the Colored youths of exceptional mental abilities and talents who
desire to fit themselves along higher educational lines, there are 86
Negro universities and colleges and numerous white universities and
colleges in the North and West where they can learn art, chemistry,
dentistry, law, medicine, music, pharmacy, theology and other higher
subjects. Up to the present time over 7000 Colored students have
graduated from American colleges and of this number upward of ten or
eleven hundred have graduated from white colleges. According to the July
1921 issue of The Crisis, 85 Colored Bachelors of Arts, &amp; Sciences, 11
Masters of Arts and 3 Doctors in Philosophy graduated from white
colleges in 1921, while 376 Bachelors of Arts, 80 Doctors of Medicine,
73 Dentists, 27 Pharmacists, 25 Lawyers and 45 Ministers graduated from
Colored colleges in 1921. The three Colored scholars who graduated from
the white colleges with the honors of Doctor of Philosophy are Misses
Eva B. Dykes, Radcliffe College; Sadie T. Mossell, University of
Pennsylvania, and Georgiana Simpson, University of Chicago. Miss Eunice
R. Hunton, “an excellent student throughout her course” has the
distinction of receiving the two honor degrees A. B. and A. M. upon her
graduation in 1921 from Smith College, Mass.</p>

<p>The first Colored person to graduate from a Northern white college was
John Brown Russworm, who graduated from Bowdoin in 1826. Aside from
holding for years the world recognition and honor of being both the
greatest scholastic and athletic university in America, Harvard
University is also known throughout the Eastern and Western Hemispheres
as practicing the truest and highest standards of broad-minded,
one-hundred percent Americanism toward its Colored students of any
similar white<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span> institution in America. As a result of such brotherhood
feelings existing there between the two races, more Negroes on an
average enter and graduate from the different departments of Harvard
than from any other great Northern white college. Its front doors (as
well as back doors) are always standing ajar with latch strings hanging
on the outside for the unembarrassed entrance of any worthy applicant
whether he be rich or poor, white or black. And when a Colored student
at Harvard joins his white school chums in singing their college
song&mdash;“Fair Harvard,” he sings it with the same fullness and pathos in
heart, the same peacefulness and contentment in mind and the same
truthfulness and sincerity in words that he hopes when he enters the
world to be able to sing in every country, over which floats the “Red
White and Blue”&mdash;“My Country ’tis of thee, sweet land of
liberty”&mdash;letting his voice come to its fullest accent and climaxing
crescendo on the word&mdash;LIBERTY.</p>

<p>Other leading white universities or colleges having encouraged and
welcomed Colored students to study in and graduate from their class
room, as well as to play and star on their varsity teams are as follows:</p>

<p>Amherst, Mass., Bates, Maine, Brown, R. I., California, Cal., Carnegie,
Pa., Chicago, Ill., Cincinnati, O.; Clark, Mass., Colby, Me., Columbia,
N. Y., Cornell, N. Y., Dartmouth, N. H., Dubuque, Ia., Illinois, Ill.,
Indiana, Ind., Kansas, Kan., Lafayette, Pa., (and the racial
broad-mindedness, human brotherhood and one-hundred percent Americanism
sentiment relative to the Negro at Lehigh University, Pa., as a student,
is becoming so pronounced there as to indicate that Lehigh may
eventually join these other white schools with her sister Lafayette in
having Colored American citizens to study and recite in her class rooms)
Massachusetts, Mass., Michigan, Mich,. New York, N. Y., Northwestern,
Ill., Ohio State, O., Pennsylvania, Pa., Pittsburgh, Pa., Radcliffe,
Mass., Rutgers, N. J., Smith, Mass., Syracuse, N. Y., Temple, Pa.,

<p>Some of the foremost Colored leaders in higher education as well as
among the most noted scholars of today are: H. S. Blackiston, Institute,

<p>Whenever a Colored person makes a phenomenal advancement in any special
and worthy field of progress, some jealous enemy of the race silently
creeps out at once, loads his donkey cart full of smoked glasses,
leather glasses, sun glasses, eye glasses, spy glasses, magnifying
glasses, old ladies’ spectacles, microscopes, telescopes, X-Rays, etc.,
etc., etc., and scoots around examining even the very breath the
unsuspecting Colored person leaves upon the air. If the surmised results
of that examination and the color of the victim’s skin in any way
suggests that he has one drop of Caucasian blood in him; then the credit
for all the success he has attained is given to the white race&mdash;just as
a little patch of white hair on the forehead of an otherwise jet black
horse is the cause of that black horse winning a race.</p>

<p>Allowing such enemies of Negroes to retain their foolish beliefs rather
than waste valuable time trying to convince them they’re wrong, the
writer, for the benefit of well-meaning but easily influenced white
people who might be led astray by the above foolish beliefs, picks out
just one from among scores of full-blooded Negroes of highest
attainments in different fields. This selected and highly gifted Negro
scholar is Dr. W. S. Scarborough, A. M., LL. D., Ph. D. about whom there
has never been the slightest question regarding his not being a genuine
Negro. He was for many years president of Wilberforce University and is
a member of at least seven national and international educational
societies the majority to which no other Negro belongs. At this writing
Dr. Scarborough has just sailed for Europe where he will represent
America in several international meetings of educational societies. He
is the author of a Greek Grammar and several other original works in
Greek.</p>

<p>Talented high school Colored youths who wish to go to college, but
hesitate to go as high as possible in education for fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span> of their
learned colored complexions displeasing other races, should remember
that:</p>

<p>The highest thing in the world (the sky) is Colored, and who is not at
all times over-joyed in spirits and much benefited in hopefulness when
seeing blue patches of the elevated sky after it has been hidden for
several days behind clouds that may even be of snowy whiteness?</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>HILE the American Negro in the field of science has not yet produced an
Agassiz, the Race has already developed two men far advanced along this
path in the persons of Dr. Ernest R. Just, Head Professor of Physiology
at Howard University and Dr. Chas. H. Turner, Professor of Biology at
Howard University.</p>

<p>As the only magna cum laude man in his class of 1907, Dr. Just graduated
from Dartmouth College, and in 1916 received his degree, Ph. D. from the
University of Chicago in zoology and physiology. Among the many
scientific subjects upon which he has written he has chiefly dwelt upon
artificial parthenogenesis and fertilization. For ten years he has spent
his summer vacations as a student in research work at the Marine
Biological Laboratory at Wood’s Hole, Mass. On account of his minute
scientific researches and conclusions he has been made a member in the
Sigma Xi and Phi Beta Kappa Societies, The American Society of
Zoologists, the American Museum, and the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.</p>

<p>In order to further inspire Negro youths who plan to make this
particular professional line their work, the writer will cite an
incident that fully proves Dr. Just’s recognition and valuation in the
world of science. During the summer of 1920, the highest scientific
organ in the United States, The National Academy of Sciences, provided a
grant to Dr. Just, through Howard University, to cover research work in
the field of physiology. As this is the first grant of its kind not only
to a Negro but to a member of any race, it further proves that hard
study and sweaty work, bull dog grit and grip to never loose your hold,
mule stubborness to brace your hind feet in holding your grounds and at
the same time flopping your ears to all discouraging sounds, taking
tor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165">{165}</a></span>toise steps slow but always forward, while keeping an eagle eye on
some chosen lofty peak, will finally result in any Colored person,
although prejudiced handicapped, reaching the highest point in any noble
calling.</p>

<p>Aside from the University of Chicago honoring him with the degree of Ph.
D. in 1907, the world’s greatest scientists in America and Europe have
weighed and found the full value of Dr. Chas. H. Turner as a Biologist
of the first order in the special fields of neurology and comparative
psychology.</p>

<p>Here and abroad scientific students and teachers alike constantly turn
for information and references to his writings on the habits and manner
of the Burrowing and Honey Bees, the Common Roach, the Mason Wasp, the
Ant and several other species of larger sized and more advanced insect
vertebrates. Some other of his research articles that have appeared in
some of the best magazines of science are Morphology of the Nervous
System of the Genus Cypris; Ecological Notes on the Cladocrea and
Copspoda of Augusta; the Mushroom Bodies of the Crawfish, Morphology of
the Avian Brain and other subjects along these lines. (Extracts from
Southern Workman, July 1920 issue, pgs. 324-26).</p>

<p>Negro boys who read these pages will notice that just as it is the
colored bees that are willing to drudge day after day in gathering and
laying aside bits by bits of the sweetest thing on earth (honey) for
future use; so has Dr. Turner (like all present and future youths must
do if they wish to gain success in any calling) been willing to
patiently and tirelessly plod ahead gathering and adding little by
little of the greatest thing on earth (knowledge) to his store of
wisdom. Today his research stack has piled up into such a vast heap that
he is now able to scatter it into scientific pastures in such aways as
to be of the most fertilizing values therein for the enriching of future
young minds and for the growing of reputation and fame for himself.</p>

<p>The most original and beneficial researches and discoveries in the
American Negro field of chemistry have been made by Prof. G. E. Carver,
Director of Agricultural Research in Chemistry at Tuskegee Institute,
Tuskegee, Ala. Chief among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span> twenty and more discovered chemical
products that are today being used as practical farm and household
necessites are as follows: dressing for canvass shoes, made from Macon
County clays; dyes made from dandelion, black oak, wood ashes, sweet
gum, willow, swamp-maple, sweet potatoes, pomegranate, peanuts, sage,
orange, muscatine grape, onions, velvet beans and tomato vines;
cotton-stalk fibre for rope, cordage, mats and carpets; furniture stains
made from native clays and vegetables; feathers for millinery purposes,
secured from native wild and barn-yard fowls; laundry blues, 20
varieties; okra fibre for paper, rope, cordage, strawboard, matting and
carpet; poplar bark for artificial ribbon; Tonic stock feed, made of
snap corn, velvet beans, cotton-seed meal, and china berries, containing
protein, 14.5 per cent., fats, 4.5;, crude fibre 12, and carbohydrates
52; Ultramarine Dyes, made from Macon County clays and used for cotton,
wool, silk, and leather; White and Color Washes, made from clays;
Wistaria for basketry work. One of his chemical products that attracted
the widest attention was Prof. Carver’s Sweet Potatoes Flour that was
successfully used during the World War by the Tuskegee Institute (which
has a population around two thousand students and instructors) as a
substitute for wheat flour. (Ref. Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919
edition, p. 42).</p>

<p>Quite a number of Colored men and women have graduated in chemistry and
physics with high honors from some of the leading universities in
America, and are today holding responsible and high salaried positions
either as professors in colleges or as consulting chemists in private
commercial corporations. Among such professors in colleges are St. Elmo
Brady and E. Chandler who have attracted unusual attention to their
chemical experiments and for their accurate conclusions have received
their Ph. D. degrees from the University of Illinois. Dr. Brady is
author of a book on chemistry.</p>

<p>For the past twenty-five years a Colored man by the name of O. W.
Collins has been employed by the R. W. Hunt Bureau of Inspection, said
to be the largest engineering corporation in America. Mr. Collins is an
analytical and consulting chemist for that corporation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span></p>

<p>Harry Keelan, a Harvard graduate, during the World War resigned a $300 a
month position as consulting chemist in a New York white firm, in order
to join some other Colored men in organizing a company for the
manufacture of dyes. In this industry he was ably assisted by E. L.
Davidson, another Harvard graduate, and the quality of their dyes was of
such high grade and standard that their firm was unable to fill the rush
orders for their products.</p>

<p>Miss Deborah Henderson graduated from the Central High School, Detroit,
Mich., attending the Oberlin College where her scholastic achievements
won her the much coveted “key”. Then entering the University of Chicago
she attended there until her graduation as a ranking bacteriologist and
chemical technician, as well as serving during her senior year as
president of the Alpha Kappa Sorority. Miss Henderson is only one among
numerous Colored women who have successfully invaded the highest
chemical fields. After reaching that stage of advancement, they have
experimentally as well as theoretically peeped and peered into many
scientific secret lanes and avenues until they learned much of the
hidden and inexhaustive mysteries therein. And with the proper
encouragements, facilities and surroundings, it is not impossible for
some American Colored women scientist some day becoming a second Madame
Curie by finally discovering and giving to the world another hidden
force of the elements, like Radium, that will greatly benefit humanity
and add much to the store of man’s scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>The following quotation is part of an article that appeared in the April
9, 1921 issue of the Chicago Defender:</p>

<p>“In the various fields of learning the race has wrought and has its
representatives; but not until now have we had a graduate doctor of
metaphysics. The pioneer in this instance is Dr. Adene C. E. Minott,
founder and head of the Clio School of Mental Sciences, Inc., 3543 State
street, this city.</p>

<p>“While yet a girl in her teens, Miss Minott showed exceptional ability.
She graduated first in her class from Grammar School No. 80, New York
City, and won the prize for general<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span> excellence from her teacher, Miss
Mary E. Eaton. Miss Minott then entered the Girl’s Technical High School
of that city and, after receiving necessary academic counts, entered the
Mac Donnall College of Phrenology and Psychology, Washington, D.C.
Because she was a Race woman, she was not permitted to study with the
regular classes, but forced to take the course by private instruction.
Despite this disadvantage, Miss Minott completed the studies in one-half
the regular time, graduated with honors and received the degree of
Bachelor of Philosophy.</p>

<p>“Returning to New York City, she next forced admittance into the
world-famed American Institute of Anthropology, perfecting herself as a
teacher in five branches of anthropology, as follows: Phrenology,
physiognomy, practical psychology, physiology and anatomy of the brain.
When she graduated from this institution, as a mark of distinction for
an excellent record, she was presented with a membership medal and
received the degree of Fellow of the American Institute of Anthropology,
this making her the only Race woman in the United States to graduate
from this institution or holding such a degree.</p>

<p>“Two years ago Prof. Minott began an intensive course in metaphysics and
business psychology at the College of Metaphysics, St. Louis, Mo. She
completed the courses and took the midwinter examinations recently,
passing with honors and receiving the title and degree of Doctor of
Metaphysics, being the first again of the Race to receive that degree in
this country.</p>

<p>“The first years of Dr. Minott’s practice were confined to an exclusive
clientele among the whites of New York City. Five years ago, however,
she was prevailed upon to establish a branch of the Clio School of
Mental Sciences in Chicago, and to centralize her efforts somewhat upon
the developing and improving of her own people. This she did, and her
efforts have met with enviable success and gratifying appreciation.”</p>

<p>Miss Minott’s unusually successful career proves that a Colored girl has
the same brain power to reach the mental heights a white girl is able to
attain, even when that Colored girl is given only half the
encouragement, half the privileges and half access<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169">{169}</a></span> to the proper
environments. It is true that all Colored girls cannot soar as high in
education as Miss Minott, but all Colored girls can improve themselves
from day to day if they will only decide to study. A cook can elevate
herself to a hairdresser; a chambermaid can elevate herself to a
dressmaker; a waitress can elevate herself to a stenographer and
typewriter; a factory girl can elevate herself to a bookkeeper and a
child’s nurse can elevate herself to a school teacher. But such girls
cannot reach such successes if they go to ball rooms and cabarets to
elevate their skirts instead of going to night schools to elevate their
minds. It all depends upon each girl herself whether she will do
drudgery work all her life or whether she will do it a few years as a
stepping stone while she is preparing herself for something higher.</p>

<p>Colored cooks, waitresses, etc., who think it is no use to develop their
minds, or study for more education just because they are Colored and
will not get a chance to use such education, should remember that:</p>

<p>They would never have grape fruits, oranges or bananas to prepare and
serve if those fruits refused to grow and develop because of their
yellow skins; they would never have coffee to serve if it had refused to
grow because it is brown; they would never have steak to broil and serve
if yellow alderney or black holstein cattle had refused to develop from
calves to cows because of their colors. Thus, if fruits, vegetables and
dumb animals keep right on growing and developing into their fullest
bloom of power and usefulness regardless of their colors; why should not
Colored girls, who have brains to think, hands to work and God to guide
them in right, do the same?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>N order to help look after the general health, advise and encourage
good physical conditions and thereby save and prolong the lives of the
several million Colored people residing in the United States, and to
assist in easing the pains and sufferings of all humanity; there are
between four and five thousand Colored physicians today practicing
medicine in America. While the majority of these professional men are
located in parts of this country where they do business exclusively
among their own people, there are hundreds of Colored doctors residing
in many other states where the number of their white patients is as
large as among their own race.</p>

<p>In 1767 there was born in Philadelphia, Pa., a slave by the name of Jas.
Derham, who in his early life was taught medicine by his white owner, a
practicing physician. After Derham had saved enough money to set himself
up in business and had secured his freedom, he moved to New Orleans,
La., where in a few years he built up both a large practice and an
independent fortune. It is said that Dr. Derham was the first Negro in
the United States to be recognized as a practicing physician.</p>

<p>Dr. Daniel H. Williams of Chicago, Ill., not only is spoken of as being
in the front rank of the foremost physicians and surgeons of the Negro
race but he is also classed with the first medical men of any race or
nation. He is the founder of the celebrated Provident Hospital and
Training School of Chicago and was Surgeon-in-Chief of the famous
Freedman’s Hospital, Washington, D.C., under President Cleveland’s
administration. His medical ability became so widely known that he has
been called to nearly every important part of the United States for
consultation. His skill in being the first surgeon to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span> successful
operation on the human heart has won him world-wide reputation. As a
result of his deep medical studies and most delicate surgical operations
he has been honored with the first Negro membership in the American
College of Surgeons.</p>

<p>Dr. Algernon B. Jackson, Phila., Pa., has the distinction of receiving a
Fellowship in the American College of Physicians, as a result of his
great all-around medical skill and especially his first discovery of a
cure for articular rheumatism. He is Head of the Mercy Hospital, which
is one of the most practically and beautifully located Colored
institutions of its kind not only in Philadelphia but in the United
States. The results of Dr. Jackson’s medical experiments and discoveries
have been published in leading medical journals and have won a name for
him here and abroad.</p>

<p>Aside from teaching as a professor in one of the leading white medical
schools in Boston, Mass., Dr. S. C. Fuller, a Neuropathologist of
nationwide fame, is also serving as a member on the medical staff of the
Massachusetts Hospital (white) for the insane. In this capacity he has
from time to time made some very valuable discoveries and suggestions
that have been accepted and put into practical and beneficial uses for
the treatment and care of the insane.</p>

<p>The honor of being the first Colored physician to be accepted as an
interne in the Bellevue Hospital, a New York City white institution of
world-wide renown, rests upon the capable shoulders of Dr. U. G.
Vincent. A few years ago he graduated with such high honors from the
University of Pa., that he was not compelled (as is usually the case) to
take the interne entrance examination when admitted to the Bellevue
Hospital.</p>

<p>Dr. Louis T. Wright, of Atlanta, Ga., now of New York, graduated from
Harvard University among the brainiest men of his class. As a young
physician both in age and practice, he is making wonderful strides along
medical paths and has already discovered a new method of vaccination
that has been tested and used by the United States Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span></p>

<p>On account of some extra special and greatly beneficial medical efforts
having been spent in their unusually successful careers, the following
names have been handed to the writer as belonging to a few of the
Colored physicians who are recognized as standing among the very highest
in their profession. E. A. Balloch, Washington, D.C., H. R. Butler,
Atlanta, Ga., J. E. Cannady, Charleston, W. Va., A. M. Curtis,
Washington, D.C., U. G. Dailey, Chicago, Ill., J. J. France, Portsmouth,
Va., S. A. Furniss, Indianapolis, Ind., J. H. Hale, Nashville, Tenn.,
Geo. C. Hall., Chicago, Ill., J. A. Kenney, Tuskegee, Ala., N. F.
Mossell, Phila., Pa., H. M. Murray, Wilmington, Del., W. L. Perry, St.

N. Y., H. A. Royster, Raleigh N. C., York Russell, New York City, N. Y.,
W. A. Warfield, Washington, D.C., and A. Wilberforce Williams, Chicago,
Ill.</p>

<p>As the result of often handicapped and hurried researches in the hundred
or more following named cities, the writer was only able to secure the
few names listed below from among the thousands of doctors unlocated but
who are just as skilled in the healing powers and just as learned in the
medical science whereever they may be practicing:</p>

<h3>Hospitals and Nurses</h3>

<p>Although American Negroes own and conduct over one hundred modernly
equipped hospitals, even that number of buildings does not afford space
enough to properly house the three thousand Colored graduate nurses now
practicing in the United States, should all those angels of mercy at the
same time apply for accommodations in the above institutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span></p>

<p>The writer regrets that as hard and patiently as he researched he was
unable to secure a list of names of the Colored women doctors who are
to-day practicing medicine in the United States. It, therefore, affords
him great pleasure, at the very last moment on the eve of this
publication coming from the press, to be able to rush in his book from
the September 24, 1921, issue of the Chicago Defender, the following
article regarding the distinguished abilities and works of one of the
numerous Negro women physicians to-day following their profession in
America:</p>

<div class="blockquot4">
<p class="cb">“WOMAN DOCTOR RECEIVES FRENCH MEDAL OF HONOR.”</p>
<p>“Newport, R. I., Sept., 23.&mdash;Dr. Harriet A. Rice, prominent in
Newport circles, received from the French government this week the
Reconnaissance Francaise, a bronze medal, awarded her in July 1919,
for her work overseas during the war. The medal reached her through
the French Embassy at Washington.</p>

<p>“Dr. Rice is a graduate of Wellesley College and of the Women’s
Medical College of New York. She served in the French military
hospital during the greater part of the war from 1915 to the
signing of the armistice, and it is for these services that she is
decorated. The medal was presented her by Prince de Bearn, charge
d’affaires of the French embassy.</p>

<p>“According to the citation which accompanied the medal, the woman
is honored by the French government because of “her devotion and
ability in caring for the French wounded during the war.”</p></div>

<p>One of the chief reasons why the United States has made such rapid and
wonderful progress along all lines of industrial civilization and today
stands first among all countries in wealth is due mostly to the original
ideas and inventive powers of the American Yankee. And to prove that the
original ideas of Negroes have had a very important part in helping to
make the United States such a leading and resourceful nation, the
following citations are but a few of the two thousand and more
inventions that Colored people in America have had patented and put on
the market for practical use.</p>

<p>“The first Negro to receive a patent on an invention was Henry Blair, of
Maryland, who, in 1834 and 1836, was granted patents on a corn
harvester. He is supposed to have been a free Negro.”</p>

<p>“Benjamin Banneker,&mdash;Noted Negro Astronomer. Born free, November 9,
1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland. Received some education in a pay
school. Early showed an inclination for mechanics. About 1754, with
imperfect tools, constructed a clock which told the time and struck the
hour. This was the first clock constructed in America.”</p>

<p>“William B. Purvis, of Philadelphia, has inventions covering a variety
of subjects, but directed mainly along a single line of experiment and
improvement. He began in 1912, the invention of machines for making
paper bags, and his improvements in this line of machinery are covered
by a dozen patents. Some half dozen other patents granted Mr. Purvis,
include three patents on electric railways, one on a fountain pen,
another on a magnetic car-balancing device, and still another for a
cutter for roll holders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">{177}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Joseph Hunter Dickinson, of New Jersey, specializes in the line of
musical instruments, particularly playing the piano. He began more than
fifteen years ago to invent devices for automatically playing the piano.
He is at present in the employ of a large piano factory. His various
inventions in piano-player mechanism are adopted in the construction of
some of the finest piano-players on the market. He has more than a dozen
patents to his credit already, and is still devoting his energies to
that line of inventions.”</p>

<p>“Frank J. Ferrell, of New York, has obtained about a dozen patents for
his inventions, the larger number of them being for improvement in
valves for steam engines.”</p>

<p>“Benjamin F. Jackson, of Massachusetts, is the inventor of a dozen
different improvements in heating and lighting devices, including a
controller for a trolley wheel.”</p>

<p>“Charles V. Richey, of Washington, D.C., has obtained about a dozen
patents on his inventions, the last of which was a most ingenius device
for registering the calls on a telephone and detecting the unauthorized
use of that instrument.”</p>

<p>“The late Granville T. Woods, of New York, and his brother, Lyates took
out some fifty or more patents. Wood’s inventions principally relate to
electrical subjects, such as telegraph and telephone instruments,
electrical railways and general systems of electrical control. Several
are on devices for transmitting telegraphic messages between moving
trains. According to Patent Office Records, several of Woods’ patents
have for valuable considerations been assigned to the foremost
electrical corporations, such as the General Electric Company, of New
York, and the American Bell Telephone Company, of New York. Mr. Woods’
inventive faculty also worked along other lines. He devised an
incubator, a complicated amusement device, a steam boiler furnace and a
mechanical brake.”</p>

<p>“John Ernest Matzeliger, born Dutch Guiana, 1852, died, Lynn,
Massachusetts, 1889. He is the inventor of the first machine that
performed automatically all the operations involved in attaching soles
to shoes. This wonderful achievement marked the beginning of a distinct
revolution in the art<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span> of making shoes by machinery. Matzeliger realized
this, and attempted to capitalize it by organizing a stock company to
market his invention; but his plans were frustrated through failing
health and lack of business experience and shortly thereafter he died.
The patent and much of the stock of the company organized by Matzeliger
was bought up. The purchase laid the foundation for the organization of
the United Shoe Machinery Company the largest and richest corporation of
the kind in the world.”</p>

<p>“During 1917-1918, Negroes made a large number of inventions. Many of
these related to the war. Charles Stevenson of Amarillo, Texas, invented
a glass war bomb. It was reported that L. A. Hayden, a native of
Charlotte, North Carolina, invented an airship stableizer which was
adopted by the British Government and that he was commissioned a Second
Lieutenant in the British aviation corps. Julius Hart of Columbus,
Georgia, invented three war bombs which were reported to be of great
military value and that for one the War Department gave him $15,000. Wm.
D. Polite, of Charlotte, North Carolina, has patented an anti-aircraft
gun.”</p>

<p>“Jacob W. F. Berry of Decatur, Alabama, invented an electrically driven
submarine. H. A. Cooper of Sabetha, Kansas, invented a submarine
detector. Henry Grady of Westbourne, Tennessee, has had patented a
Torpedo-Catcher and a Mine Destroyer.”</p>

<p>“The ‘national safety helmet’ or hood, invented by Garrett A. Morgan of
Cleveland, is reported to have been used by the United States and the
Allies to combat poisonous gases and as a safety device on Submarines.
The ‘Safety Hood and Smoke Protector’ was originally invented for
firemen.</p>

<p>“In addition to seven American patents on this device, Mr. Morgan holds
patents for Canada, England, Germany and other countries. This invention
received a gold medal prize from the American Museum of safety and the
first grand prize at the second Inter-National Convention of Safety and
Sanitation which was held at New York City. In 1914, the Inter-National
Fire chie<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span>f’s Association in session in New Orleans, voted Mr. Morgan a
gold honorary membership badge. ‘The safety hood’ is manufactured by the
Safety Device Company of which Mr. Morgan is the general manager. As a
protection for firemen, it is in use in a large number of cities.”</p>

<p>“H. C. Webb of Bradentown, Florida, is the inventor of the Webb Palmetto
Grubbing Machine, which removes the stumps from 5 to 10 acres of land
per day.”</p>

<p>C. J. Perry, of Cincinnati, O., has invented a hydro-carbon device that
saves 10 to 20 percent of coal fuel and also consumes 85 percent of the
smoke. This invention is now in use on the Milwaukee Railroad and in the
Metropole Hotel in Chicago, Ill. C. H. Jackson has invented a diving
outfit with which the world record for deep-sea diving has been broken.
Miss Alice H. Parker, of Washington, D.C., has received a patent on a
heating furnace. Wm. Solder, Boston, Mass., has been given a patent on a
cooking stove and water heater combined.</p>

<p>“The largest number of patents received on inventions, by a Negro, was
by Elijah McCoy, of Detroit, Michigan. McCoy obtained his first patent
in July, 1872, and his last one in 1917. During this period of forty
years he invented one thing after another and has some fifty-eight
patents to his credit. His inventions cover a wide range of subjects,
but relate particularly to the lubricating of machinery. He was a
pioneer in the art of steadily supplying oil to machinery in
intermittent drops from a cup so as to avoid the necessity for stopping
the machine to oil it. McCoy’s lubricating cup was famous thirty years
ago as a necessary equipment for all-up-to-date machinery.” (quotations
from Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, pgs. 5-6-7-8-341-2-3-4)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE first Colored poetess in America to win national and international
fame was Phyllis Wheatley, who was brought from Africa in 1761 and sold
as a slave in Boston, Mass. Finding Phyllis to be an unusually quick and
apt child to learn, her owner spared no pains to give her the best of
education. Her poetry writing began at an early age. She became so
intelligent and self-cultured that the most wealthy and refined white
people of the day entertained her. All the time she was writing verses
of the highest quality. Finally going to Europe her success was even
greater there to such an extent that she appeared before the Royal
Courts of England and received high honors. Her literary works were
reviewed by some of the best scholars in England where much of her
poetry was published in London under the title “Poems on Various
Subjects, Religious and Moral”.</p>

<p>The late Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Negro Poet-Laureate, is considered the
greatest poet the Negro race has produced. Starting as an elevator boy
he struggled through one disappointment after another to get an
education. All that time he was writing poetry and finally after his
works came under the notice of such great white writers as William Dean
Howells and James Whitcomb Riley, the genius of Dunbar and the value of
his writings became world known. He traveled all about giving recitals
of his poetry that took the country by storm. His prose works won just
as much admiration and comment. His writings were based on the American
Negro in and out of slavery and the pen pictures he has drawn are
masterpieces of literature. Chief among his compositions are; “Lyrics of
Lowly Life”, “Lyrics of The Hearthstone,” “Heart of Happy Hollow”,
“Folks From Dixie,” “Oak and Ivy”, “Uncalled”, “Love and Landry” and
“The Sports Of The Gods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181">{181}</a></span>”</p>

<p>William Stanley Braithwaite, as editor of “The New Poetry Review” of
Cambridge, author of “The Anthology of Magazine Verse”, editor of “The
Contemporary American Poets Series” and annual reviewer of the poetry
that appears in the leading magazines of America, is recognized as the
leading Colored poet and among the foremost world poets of today. A few
of his works are: “The House of Falling Leaves”, “The Book of Victorian
Verse”, “Life of Lyrics and Love”, “The Book of Georgian Verse”, “The
Book of Elizabethian Verse”, and “The Book of Restoration Verse.” He was
awarded the Spingarn Medal in 1918.</p>

<p>James Weldon Johnson is a poet and writer of first note, and his poem
“The Young Warrior,” that was set to music by Harry T. Burleigh, almost
became the national hymn of Italy during the World War. His poem “Fifty
Years” that appeared in many of the leading white magazines and
newspapers during the first part of 1913, brought forth high comment
from all parts of the country. His poems have appeared in the Century,
the Independent, the Crisis and other publications. He has published
some of his poetry in a book titled “Fifty Years and Other Poems.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Johnson is a young colored poet of America. Some of his verse is in
the cultivated English, some in the broken language of the American
Negro. The latter rings true. They express with singular intensity the
joys and sorrows of a subject race.” The above comment was made by The
London Literary World regarding the poetic abilities of Fenton Johnson,
Chicago, Ill. Aside from receiving high mentions from The New York
World, and Poetry, a magazine of Verse, some of his works were also
included in Braithwaite’s “Anthology of Magazine Verse for 1918” and
“The Chicago Anthology”. One of his recent volumes of poetry that
attracted praiseworthy attention on both sides of the ocean is “A Little
Dreaming.”</p>

<p>While the facts, that short stories of the highest order are constantly
flowing from her pen point (or typewriter) and that she is Literary
Editor of The Crisis, have gained for her the distinction of being a
foremost prose writer among Colored women<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">{182}</a></span> in America today; Jessie
Redmon Fauset, on account of the numerous outputs and unusual high
quality of her poems, is also recognized as one of the best verse
writers among Colored people on both sides of the ocean.</p>

<p>The father and son poets, Jos. S. Cotter, Sr. and Jr., have produced
verse matter that stands among the best in the country among Colored
writers. Information regarding the works of these composers will be
found else-where in this book. But a praiseworthy mention regarding Jos.
S. Cotter, Jr., who died in his early twenties and for several years
before that had been confined on a bed of affliction, should be made
herein. While other poets have had their health, strength and vigor to
do their work, young Cotter was suffering almost constant pain in bed
while turning out his poetry that came from the depths of his patient
soul, and ring as true as a pure-cast bell.</p>

<p>Georgia Douglas Johnson was born in Atlanta, Ga., was educated in the
public schools and at the Atlanta University after which she took a
course of music at the Oberlin Conservatory. Her first book, “The Heart
of a Woman and Other Poems” with an introduction by William Stanley
Braithwaite, was published by the Cornhill Co. of Boston, Mass., three
years ago; her second book, “An Autumn Love Cycle,” will be out shortly.
Her third book, “Shadow Song” is entirely different to the other two,
being entirely racial, treated in the over-tone style of suggestion.
This book will appear some months after the “Love Cycle.” The above
quotation is in part an editorial note that appeared in the May 1921
issue of Music and Poetry. The high standard and amazing numbers of Mrs.
Johnson’s verses that appear in leading magazines are attracting wide
attention and have already placed her in a class among the leading
Colored writers before the public today.</p>

<p>Claude McKay, a poet of international reputation, enjoys the honor of
being one of the first Colored writers to be made an associate editor on
the staff of a white national magazine&mdash;The Liberator, which is
published in New York City. Mr. McKay has for several years been writing
poetry for many of the leading magazines in Europe as well as for
Colored and white<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183">{183}</a></span> periodicals in America. His book, “Spring in New
Hampshire and Other Poems” has brought forth high literary comment from
verse critics in both countries.</p>

<p>“Miscellaneous Poems” and “Sketches of Southern Life” are two titles
covering some of the verses produced by the poetess, Frances E. Harper,
who also wrote first quality prose. Jas. E. McGirth wrote “Some Simple
Songs” and other verse matter that has stood the test of the best
critics.</p>

<p>The late J. D. Corrothers gained much distinction as a prose and verse
writer and for several years his poems appeared in some of the leading
white magazines. George R. Margeston’s book of poems “Songs of Life” has
brought forth much favorable comment, and stamped him as a poet who is
fast forging to the front.</p>

<p>All verse critics who regularly read the close-to-nature, true-to-life,
heart-to-heart and cheerful little poems that weekly head the editorial
pages of the Chicago Defender, join in acclaiming Alfred Anderson the
Edgar A. Guest “Sunshine Poet” of the Negro Race. A few of the many
other Colored verse writers whose poems frequently appear in leading
magazines are Carrie C. Clifford, Sergt. Allen R. Griggs, Jr., Thos. M.
Henry, Sarah C. Fernandas, Leslie P. Hill, Roscoe Jamison, Chas. Bertram
Johnson, Winifred Virginia Jordan, Will Sexton and Lucian B. Watkins,
the last named writer being considered among the foremost writers the
race has produced during the past few years.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span>ccording to page 331 of the 1918-1919 edition of Work’s Negro Year
Book, “Bannister, E. M., of Providence, Rhode Island, was one of the
first Negroes in America to achieve distinction as a painter. He was the
founder of the Providence Art Club, which is to-day the leading art
organization in Providence. “Its membership, mostly, if not wholly
white, includes many of the leading citizens of the city and state.” One
of Mr. Bannister’s pictures “Under the Oaks” was awarded a medal at the
Centennial Exposition of 1876. The picture became the property of the
Duffe Estate of New York City.”</p>

<p>Henry O. Tanner, born in Pittsburgh, Pa., and now living in Paris,
France, is the greatest artist in the Negro race and among the best of
all races. His early life along artistic lines was one of hard
struggles, constant ambitions, unshaken determinations and final
success, until today his works are known and treasured all over the
world. His most successful paintings are those describing different
incidents that are taught in the Bible. Among his many pictures that
have won fame and fortunes for him are; “The Banjo Lesson”, “Christ
Walking on the Sea”, “The Holy Family”, “Hills Near Jerusalem”, “Christ
at the Home of Lazarus”, “Mary and Elizabeth” and “The Hiding of Moses.”
Mr. Tanner is the son of Bishop B. T. Tanner.</p>

<p>“Mr. William Scott is considered by critics to be one of the foremost
artists in America. He excells alike in the difficulties of portrait
painting and in the cleverness and subtlety of his cartoon work. In a
time when artists are becoming more and more a necessity of modern life,
his ability bids fair to lift him even more to the top of his
profession. Mr. Scott led his class at the Chicago Art Institute.” This
quotation is extracted from the November-December 1920 issue of Fenton
Johnson’s Favorite Magazine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span></p>

<p>The following extract about Mr. Scott is from Work’s Negro Year Book,
1918-1919 edition, page 331: “He took the Magnus Brand Prize for two
successive years. He studied in Paris at the Julian Academy and under
Henry O. Tanner. Three of his paintings were accepted by the Salon des
Beaux Arts at Toquet. The Argentine Republic purchased one of his
pictures, La Pauvre Voisine. He has completed Mural paintings for public
buildings in Evanston, Illinois; Chicago and Indianapolis. He is
interesting himself in Negro subjects and is doing in painting what
Dunbar has done in verse.”</p>

<p>The late Wm. A. Harper of Chicago, Ill., although a young man at his
death had already won recognition for his paintings and himself. He had
spent two year of study in Paris and has been successful in exhibiting
his paintings at the Chicago Art Institute. Chief among his works are
“The Last Gleam”, “The Hillside”, and “The Gray Day.”</p>

<p>A few of the many present day Colored artists who have also become
recognized and prominent in this art are; Lulu Adams, Los Angles, Cal.;
Ernest Atkinson, Baltimore, Md.; C. L. Boydkin, Boston, Mass.; C. L.
Dawson, Chicago, Ill.; Arthur Diggs, J. B. Davidson, Washington, D.C.;
W. M. Farrow, Frances Grant, Marcellus Hawkins, Chicago, Ill.; J.
Hardwick, L. Harris, Louise Latimer, Brooklyn, N. Y.; Effie Lee,
Wilberforce, Ohio; L. M. Rogers, Harvey Roseland, Washington, D.C.; A.
A. Smith, New York; Frank Waltz, N. Y.; Hilda Wilkerson, Arthur Winslow,
Chicago, Ill.; and Sidney Woodward, New York, (some of above names are
extracts from Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, pg. 331.)</p>

<p>Miss Laura Wheeler’s painting “Heirlooms” won first place in New York
City among 500 art exhibits at the Water Color Club. Aside from being an
instructor in the art department of the Cheyney School, Cheyney, Pa.,
and illustrator for such national magazines as The Crisis, she is
recognized as one of the foremost Colored women artists in America.</p>

<p>At the John Wanamaker Art Exhibition held in Philadelphia, Pa., not many
months ago, K. G. Ganaway, a Colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span> butler in Chicago, Ill., entered
his photographic picture “The Spirit of Transportation”, which won first
prize out of 900 pictures exhibited by many of the country’s most
experienced and expert white photographers residing in different parts
of the United States. While other people in going to railroad stations
saw nothing interesting there but hurrying crowds of people, truck loads
of baggage and black sooty trains and sheds, Mr. Ganaway’s artistic eye
and timely focused camera soared above those common place things as he
saw and portrayed the wonderful beauty of the dust laden tapering and
yellow beams of lights and shadows caused by the sun’s golden rays
streaming through the dingy skylights of the Terminal’s high and arched
ceilings.</p>

<h3>Architects</h3>

<p>In nearly every American city of importance where the Negro population
is large there are Colored architects of recognized standing and
ability. The following are just a few of those names that have come
under the hurried notice of the writer: W. T. Bailey, Memphis, Tenn.; A.
I. Cassell, Baltimore, Md.; W. C. Cook, Gary, Ind.; W. H. Hammond,
Pittsburgh, Pa.; I. T. Hatton, Washington, D.C.; Benjamin and William
Hazel, Boston, Mass.; Harry S. James, Seattle, Washington, now in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil; H. N. Johnson, Norfolk, Va.; the late J. T. N. Minot,
New York City; J. C. Norman, Charleston, W. Va.; J. W. Robinson and
Henry Robinson, Hampton, Va.; Chas. T. Russell, A. M. Segoins,
Baltimore, Md., V. W. Tandy, New York City, W. T. White, Kansas City,
Mo. and P. R. Williams, Los Angeles, Cal.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">P</span>REJUDICE against her race and sex did not deter the colored girl,
Edmonia Lewis, from struggling upward to honor and fame as a sculptor.”
This is what was written about that great genius on page 64 in “Pushing
To The Front” one of the books of Orison Swett Marden, who aside from
being editor of the New Success Magazine is also known in all lands as
the greatest and widest read inspirational white writer in the world
today. Among the chief works of Miss Lewis are: “The Death of Cleopatra”
that was exhibited in 1876 at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia,
Pa., “The Freed Woman”, “The Marriage of Hiawatha” and the bust of
Robert Gould Shaw.</p>

<p>Residing in So. Framington, Mass., is Meta Vaux Warrick (Mrs. S. C.
Fuller) who is considered a leading Colored sculptress in America today.
What is known as her masterpiece, “The Wretched”, a sculptured group,
was exhibited in Paris in 1903. Some of her other productions are; “The
Silent Appeal”, “The Dancing Girl”, “The Wrestlers”, and “The Immigrant
in America.”</p>

<p>Standing in the front ranks of this art is May Howard Jackson of
Washington, D.C. In both the Vorhoff Art Gallery and the Corcoran Art
Gallery the results of her talents have been successfully exhibited. Her
recent bust of Paul Lawrence Dunbar, that was unveiled in one of the
Washington High Schools, has aroused much interest and favorable comment
not only in the national capital but throughout the country. (Ref.:

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">E</span>ACH new day echoes the triumph of some individual who has gloriously
bridged chasms of earthly deterrents&mdash;racial, financial, mental,
physical and moral&mdash;during which time that individual has been torn and
left naked, bleeding and despondent; but to the brave these vicissitudes
never weaken, but strengthen, and they fight with the tenacity of a
savage, finally reaping conquest after conquest. Roland Hayes, tenor of
Boston illustrates the result of being firm, holding on, fighting, and
today he has achieved what every artist desires as a reward of their
genius, their years of struggle to excell, the recognition of the world,
of kings and queens. And May 2 the cables flashed word that a Negro
tenor had been received at the palace to sing for the royal family, and
was presented a diamond pin by King George, the significant manner in
which royalty pays homage to great musicians of the world. They were
delighted with the voice and manner of the singer, and the king observed
how different the songs were from what the English were taught to
believe were characteristic Negro melodies. We have always been
caricatured, always portrayed as the jester for the world’s amusement,
and Mr. Hayes did not overlook the opportunity to rescue our folk songs
from the debasement they have suffered from the result of pernicious
money mongers, and present them as the sorrow songs of a persecuted
people filled with weariness and renunciation.</p>

<p>“His sojourn in London has been marked with success after success,
beginning with his premiere recital, significant with concurrent praise
from the critics. An appearance at the dinner given by the American
Society to British women at the Hotel Cecil, on which occasion he sang
“The Star-Spangled Banner.” His appearances at two concerts given by the
Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Choral Society (Mrs. I. F. Coleridge-Taylor,
patron;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span> Sir. Charles V. Stanford, president, and Douglas M. Durston,
conductor) in aid of the mayor’s unemployment fund and numerous
concerts, the last of which, April 16, was a huge success financially
and artistically. The critics said many lovely things of Mr. Hayes anent
his voice, his style, his intelligence and manner; but to us who know
and love him, who feel his very heart throb as he pleads through his art
for his people, recognize and understand that his voice wails in
eagerness for deliverance, freedom, the right to breathe and live
untrammeled and unoppressed.</p>

<p>“A word is here appropriate in praise of Lawrence Brown, who has been
his sympathetic accompanist and collaborator in the settings of a number
of spirituals for concert use. Mr. Brown is also an excellent pianist,
and the critics recognize his dual talent by always giving him a share
in their notes.”</p>

<p>The above quotation is extracted from an editorial that appeared on page
13 in the May 1921 issue of Nora Douglas Holt’s monthly magazine, Music
and Poetry, that is published in Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>Mr. Hayes received his musical education in the New England conservatory
of Music, Boston, Mass., and today is acclaimed not only the foremost
tenor in the Negro race but one of the greatest tenors in the world.</p>

<p>Colored and white song critics on both sides of the ocean have for many
years recognized Harry T. Burleigh as the leading baritone soloist in
the Negro race. For the past twenty or more years he has been a soloist
in the choir of the St. George’s Protestant Church, which is one of the
leading and wealthiest white churches in New York City, having on its
membership roll such world-known names as Seth Low and J. Pierpont
Morgan. Mr. Burleigh is also a composer of international fame, and his
“Deep River” is frequently sung in different parts of the world by
famous white singers. More mention of Mr. Burleigh’s celebrated
compositions will be made elsewhere in this book.</p>

<p>“Guide to Voice Culture” is a book written by Madame E. Azalia Hackley.
This book is soundly based on the ripe and rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span> experiences gained by
Mrs. Hackley after an untiring and extensive preparation under the best
voice culture masters in America and Europe. For many years she was the
most prominent Colored singer in America. For several years past she has
been devoting her time and energies in traveling throughout the country
organizing and presenting chorus recitals dealing mostly or wholly with
American Negro folklore songs. In thus constantly coming in personal
contact with the masses of Colored people in all parts of the United
States, Mrs. Hackley is doing more today than any musician in personally
meeting and influencing so many Colored people to learn to love, sing,
and preserve Negro plantation melodies.</p>

<p>Anita Patti Brown of Chicago, Ill., is today one of the most eminent
sopranos belonging to the Negro race. She has made numerous and
unusually successful trips throughout America and the West Indies, and
those who have heard her remarkable singing instantly fall in love with
her full round voice of natural richness and sweetness. Among her most
catchy pieces is the one titled “Villanelle” which has been reproduced
on Columbia Phonograph records with great success.</p>

<p>Florence Cole Talbert, aside from winning the diamond medal at the
Chicago Musical College has also won national reputation as one of the
leading sopranos among the American Colored people. Although high up on
the ladder of songhood, she is continuing to climb to the top by taking
special courses in Chicago under such famed teachers as Oscar Saenger
and Madame Valerie. This great singer’s home is in Detroit, Michigan.</p>

<p>Cleota Collins, Columbus, Ohio, is a soprano of note, and, as the editor
of Music and Poetry has so well said, “is a young woman with a frail
body but such an enormous mentality and a voice that makes you close
your eyes and listen to her interpretation of songs that set your senses
titilating. But she has worked patiently to acquire this power and now
condescends to tell young students how she did it.” She is associate
editor of Music and Poetry.</p>

<p>Although he is at present living in New Zealand, where he has endeared
himself in the hearts of all music lovers there H. Hodges can be rightly
claimed an American product on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span> of his native home being Boston,
Mass. His commanding and well trained talented voice is one of the
wonders of Auckland where he conducts one of the most exclusive music
studios.</p>

<p>After spending several years of personal sacrifices and hard study in
America, France and England, Rachel Walker of Cleveland, Ohio was
finally rewarded by receiving personal recognition and praise from kings
and queens during her first successful appearance in Europe. And today
she is classed among the best of American Colored song birds.</p>

<p>Worcester, Mass., and New England in general is justified in being so
proud of Estelle P. Clough who has won for herself first place among
great Colored singers. She has successfully appeared in most of the
important cities in the United States.</p>

<p>Wm. H. Richardson of Boston, Mass., is one of the best Colored baritones
in America. He has made numerous joint recitals with Maud Cuney Hare
through the United States and has met with great success on all
occasions.</p>

<p>In singing compositions of Negro, French, German, Italian and Russian
musicians, Wilson Lamb of Orange, N. J., demonstrates in his recitals
that he has a baritone voice of marked agreeableness and unusual
control. Each year when he gives his big recitals his voice shows the
favorable results of his continued hard study and practice, and white
papers are unstinting in giving him praise.</p>

<p>For twenty years Sisseretta Jones has successfully managed a musical
company of her own organization known as “The Black Patti Troubadors”.
In all the European cities they visited they had over-crowded houses
night after night. It must be said to the glowing credit and praise of
Madame Jones that she is probably the only woman in America, Colored or
white, who has been successful in organizing and keeping together for so
many years such a high-classed group of musical entertainers.</p>

<p>During the early eighties Madame Selika better known as “Black Patti”,
went to Europe and completely captivated the friendship of music lovers
in the “Old Country” by her marvelous birdlike thrills and matchless
renditions of her famous “Echo Song.” The great range and sweetness of
her voice was a delightful mystery to all who heard her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span></p>

<p>It was as far back as 1851, at the time the world-famed Jenny Lind
(white) was enjoying her greatest fame, that Elizabeth T. Greenfield a
Colored woman came into prominence as a noted singer. She was often
called the “Black Jenny Lind” and won fame in America and Europe where
she was given the pet name of “The Black Swan.”</p>

<p>In the minds of many people still living there are yet fond
recollections of that human song bird, Flora Batson, (Mrs. Bergen) who
was born in Providence, R. I.. The music people in America, Europe,
Africa, Australia and New Zealand considered it a rare treat to hear her
touching and pathetic voice that had such bell-like tones and clarity of
enunciation. For ninety-one continuous nights at a revival in New York
City her voice held vast crowds spellbound as they tearfully listened to
her soul-touching voice sing “Six Feet of Earth Make Us All One Size.”
And hundreds of curious and prejudiced white people who first went to
those meetings to jeer and make fun had their set minds suddenly
converted by listening to the truth and full meaning of that song and
had their frozen hearts completely melted by the soulful shocks of that
great singer’s voice. (Ref. Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition,
pgs. 326-7-8).</p>

<p>Anna and Emma Hyers, soprano and contralto; Wallace Kine, tenor; John
Lucca and Frederick Louidin, Bassos, of the Old School, were among the
foremost singers of their times and proved vocal marvels to all who
heard them sing in America and Europe. For years the well trained and
talented quartettes of Fisk University, Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes
have been winning fame throughout America and even in Europe as
unsurpassed singers of Negro plantation songs.</p>

<p>Below are the names of just a few human Colored song-birds of today whom

<p>Having as its object, “To foster Negro talent; labor for economic and
educational betterment”, The National Association of Negro Musicians,
under the wise leadership of Henry L. Grant, is wielding a musical
influence for good that is being felt and appreciated not only by
American Colored and white musicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span> but by music lovers of both races
even abroad. Other nationally known musicians, who, as officers in this
organization, are ably assisting their president in furthering the
inspirational and elevating work of this organ are; Melville Charleton,
R. Nathaniel Dett, Carl Diton, Kemper Herreld, Nora Douglass Holt,
Deacon Johnson, H. P. B. Johnson, R. Agustus Lawson, W. H. Loving,
Harriet G. Marshall, James A. Mundy, Alice Carter Simmons, T. Theo.
Taylor, Clarence C. White and Fred J. Work.</p>

<p>If there be Colored youths who, after reading these inspirational pages,
still lack ambition and courage to develop musical talents they possess,
because of their race and color, such youths should remember that:&mdash;</p>

<p>The most popular and sweetest singing bird in the world (the canary) is
Colored. But if hundreds of years ago that bird had ruined his
God-gifted voice with discouraged croakings about its yellow feathers,
the canary bird of today would be not able to sing so sweetly as to
cause its listeners to completely forget it is a bird with a colored
complexion. Its singing is so sweet and beautiful that people learn to
see beauty and loveliness in its yellow coat that Nature has given it.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">“T</span>HE Negro race has produced two violinists who have attracted national
attention as artists, Clarence Cameron White and Joseph H. Douglass.
They occupy first rank among American musicians and the race is justly
proud of them.” The above quotation that originally appeared in the
American artists Review, is an extract from Work’s Negro Year Book,
1918-1919 edition, p. 329.</p>

<p>Mr. White, whose home is in Boston, has spent many years of hard
studying in both America and Europe, and aside from being a violinist of
the first rank, he is also a noted composer. One of his greatest
compositions “The Cradle Song” is written for either the violin or piano
and has brought praises from all critics who have heard it. “A New
System of One Octave Scale Studies for the Violin”, of which Mr. White
is the author, is a book that is being used extensively in music
schools.</p>

<p>Joseph Henry Douglass, grandson of the great Frederick Douglass, is a
native of Washington, D.C. The foundation of his superb playing of today
was laid in the New England Conservatory of Music, the New York
Conservatory of Music and some of the best music schools in London.
During the score or more years he has made annual recitals throughout
the country, he, the same as Mr. White, has played before presidents of
the United States. Mr. Douglass fills the responsible position of
Instructor in Instrumental Music at Howard University, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>A few of some other violinists of the first order are; Wm. Butler,
Walter Craig, Brooklyn, N.Y., Harrison Farrell, Harrison Emanuel,
Chicago, Ill., Kemper Herreld, Atlanta, Ga., Edwin F. Hill,
Philadelphia., Pa., Louisa V. Jones, New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span> Leonard Jeter, New York
Hall, Johnson, H. Kerr, Baltimore, Md., David L. Martin, New York,
Eugene Mars Martin, New York, A. W. Ross, New York, Prof. Tenyck,
Brooklyn, N.Y., Harrison Watts, Baltimore, Md.</p>

<p>Maud Cuney Hare of Boston, Mass., has for years been recognized as one
of the leading pianists in America. She is nationally and
internationally known and her playing has met the stamped approval of
the most critical of critics. She is a member of the Music and Lecture
Guild of New England (a white organization) and is also music critic for
the Crisis Magazine.</p>

<p>As an accomplished musician, Hazel Harrison is one of the best among the
best Colored or white pianists in America. Although a musical prodigy
from early childhood, her youthful life has been one constant grind of
theory, study and practical application under such world-known pianists
and teachers as Busoni, Egan, Petri and Victor Heinne. And still she
improves.</p>

<p>Helen Hagan is another pianist who is recognized as being among the
foremost musicians in the United States, as the result of her strenuous
studies under such noted French masters as Saint-Saens, Vincent D’Indy,
Claude Debussy and her playing under the severe criticisms of Gabriel
Faure, Paul Dukas, Chaussons and Severac. As one of the associate
editors on the staff of Music and Poetry, she is doing great
inspirational work in its piano department.</p>

<p>Carl Diton’s transcription of “Swing Low Sweet Chariot” for the organ
has been published by G. Schirmer Co., one of the largest white music
publishers in America. This composition has a melody of remarkable
sweetness and is one of the few pieces that brings into full play all
parts of the organ. Mr. Diton has studied in Europe as well as in
America and today is recognized as one of the leading pianists,
organists and composers in this country.</p>

<p>Melville Charlton of Brooklyn, N. Y., is estimated by knowing critics as
being one of the most talented and efficient pipe organist among Colored
people in America. He is an unquestioned authority on this instrument
that has taken up many of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span> years in theory study and practical
application. The following named are a few mentioned from among the
hundreds of other exceptionally trained organists in different parts of
the country: Rudolph Grant, New York, William King, Phila., Pa., George
Ruffin and Fred White, Boston, Mass., Mrs. Corinne Wilson, Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>“It Takes Love to Cure the Heart’s Disease”, “Loveless Love” and
“Caroline Shout” were among the first player-piano rolls that were
recorded by Jas. P. Johnson, a Colored pianist, who has signed a
contract to make recordings for the Q. R. S. Music Company, which is the
largest player-piano roll manufacturers in the world.</p>

<p>One of the greatest musical wonders, Colored or white, America has ever
produced was Thomas G. Bethune, who was born a blind slave at Columbus,
Ga., He became known throughout the world as “Blind Tom”. He played
difficult pieces on the piano when only four years old and began giving
concerts when eight years old. Although he had never received any
instructions he could correctly imitate the most difficult piece after
hearing it played but once. He was taken to Europe where he won fame and
honors playing before the crowned heads in all of the important
countries. His audiences would sit spellbound and entranced as he
imitated on the piano nearly every imaginable sound. Especially were
they moved and seemed to feel they were going through the actual
experience when he played “The Shipwreck.” At such times his magic
fingers drew from the ivory keys the far and low rumblings of fast
coming storms; the clanking of rattling chains among hastening crews;
the weird moans of increasing winds; the blood-curdling shrieks of
swooping sea-gulls; the distant booms of beach-breaking waves; the
flapping slaps of wind-whipped sails; the creaking timbers of
tossed-about ships; the soft murmurs of praying voices; the sudden
crashes of lightning bolts; loud rolling peals of overhead thunder and
the splashing sounds of down-pouring rains.</p>

<p>Another piano prodigy of the race is J. W. Boone of Columbia, Mo., who
became blind in his infancy. He is known as “Blind Boone” and although
he has been touring the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span> for forty years, he is still giving
piano recitals that hold his audiences in wonder and awe. He has such a
wonderful memory for musical details and such a delicate ear for
detecting musical sounds that he frequently listens to the playing of a
recognized pianist who has the sight of both eyes, and when that person
has finished, “Blind Boone” will go to the piano and amuse the audience
by showing the mistakes made by the other player and then presenting the
piece correctly. By many critics he is considered today as the equal if
not the superior of the famous “Blind Tom”. (Ref. Work’s Negro Year
Book, 1918-1919 edition, pgs. 327-28-29).</p>

<p>Named below are a few of the many Colored pianists in America today,
many of them having studied under some of the best masters in Europe as
well as in America, and all of them being finished musicians, and

<p>The Pace Phonograph Corporation, New York City, is the first of its kind
in the world to be composed only of Colored people. It is presided over
by Harry H. Pace, a Colored man<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span> who founded it, and it is turning out
records reproducing only Negro music sung or played only by Colored
musicians. All of its officials and employees are Colored, and its chief
purpose is to preserve in vocal form such as are left of the slave-songs
of America. Its records are known as the “Black Swan Records,” that are
already in much demand and finding large sales.</p>

<p>Today the original and unique, singing of Perry Bradford’s “blues” by
Mamie Smith, is attracting admiration and endless praise on both sides
of the ocean. Her successful singing for the reproduction of her voice
on the records of the Okeh Phonograph Co., has made her the first
Colored female singer to so suddenly achieve world fame along that line.
It is said that the royalties from her records amount to such a sum that
it would gladden and look big in the eyes of even prima donna singers in
the operatic world. The records containing her voice are in such demand
by the public that the manufacturers turning out the disc have to put on
night shifts in conjunction with day shifts in order to fill the orders
piled up on their desks. In the fall of 1920 Miss Smith’s stage singing
had become so popular that she had to table engagements from Paris and
London in order to fill a thirty week touring engagement in the United
States.</p>

<p>Band Musicians throughout the world heard of and learned to admire the
late James Reese Europe, who was one of the greatest “jazz” musicians
the world has ever heard. Of the four best bands overseas during the
World War and representing the four greatest nations, James Europe’s
American Colored bandmen were in demand more than any of the others,
especially in England and France.</p>

<p>At the St. Louis World Exposition of 1904 and at the Panama Exposition
held at San Francisco, Cal., in 1915, Major W. H. Loving, as conductor
of the famous Philippine Band, was among those who were awarded the
highest band honors for being among the greatest bandmasters of the
world. Other Colored musicians who have achieved success and recognition
as band leaders are quite numerous in America, and a few of them are
mentioned herewith; Lieut. Tim Bryan, F. L. Drye, W. H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span> Howard, W. L.
Jackson, C. Wesley Johnson, N. Clarke Smith, A. J. Thomas, W. H. Vodery,
and P. G. Lowery who has developed such a great band that yearly
throughout the seasons it is to be found with the Ringling Bro. Show as
one of its most important bands. W. H. Graham, as well as a great band
leader is a talented composer of band music. His home is in Denver,
Colorado.</p>

<p>According to the determinations of one of America’s nationally
recognized authorities and critics on Negro music composition, the
following ten named Colored composers are among the foremost in the
United States:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Harry T. Burleigh, whose “Deep River”, “Jean” and “The Soldier” are
three of his voice compositions that are among his numerous
spirituals and art-songs published by Ricordi &amp; Co., New York City.
For his work as a singer and composer, Mr. Burleigh was awarded the
1917 Spingarn Medal.</p>

<p>Melville Charlton, whose piano production: Poeme Crotique is
published by Schirmer &amp; Co., New York City.</p>

<p>Will Marion Cook, whose “The Bandanna Land”, “The Casino Girl”, and
“The Rain Song” are among his popular choruses in Negro style that
are published by Schirmer &amp; Co., New York City. As director of The
New York Syncopated Orchestra and the celebrated Clef Club
Orchestra, Mr. Cook has won himself a place among the first-place
orchestra leaders in America and Europe.</p>

<p>R. Nathaniel Dett, whose chorals: “Chariot Jubilee”, “Listen To The
Lambs” and “I’m So Glad Trouble Don’t Last Alway” are among his
voice spirituals published by John Church Co., New York City; his
piano composition “Magnolia” which is one among others published by
Summy &amp; Co., Chicago. A white publication, Musical America of
December 17, 1919, said, “If R. Nathaniel Dett had written no other
work, his “Chariot Jubilee” would suffice to make his name.” Mr.
Dett is also a noted pianist.</p>

<p>Carl Diton, whose pipe Organ production; “Swing Low Sweet, Chariot”
is published by Schirmer &amp; Co., New York City,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201">{201}</a></span> and whose voice
composition; “Swing Low Sweet Chariot” is published by Presser &amp;
Co., Philadelphia, Pa.</p>

<p>Helen Hagan, who has composed for the piano; Concerto with
orchestral accompaniment (manuscript).</p>

<p>J. Harvey Hebron, who has produced for the voice splendid
semi-classic ballads (American Magazine Co., 1514 South St.,
Phila., Pa.,) and for the violin and piano: Sonata in E
(manuscript).</p>

<p>J. Rosamond Johnson, whose classic ballads and light operas have
been written for the white company, Klaw &amp; Erlanger and such noted
white actresses as Lillian Russell. In the production of many of
his pieces, J. Rosamond was ably assisted by his brother James
Weldon Johnson who also was the translator for the English libretto
of “Goyescas” the Spanish grand opera produced by the Metropolitan
Opera Company in 1915. James W. also has several French music
translations to his credit. The works of J. Rosamond Johnson are
published by Ditson &amp; Co., Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>Gerald Tyler, who has composed for the voice, Art-songs that are
published by Schirmer &amp; Co., New York City.</p>

<p>Clarence Cameron White, whose violin Spirituals are published by
Carl Fisher &amp; Co., New York.</p></div>

<p>The “blue song” compositions of W. C. Handy are known and sung all over
the world. He is president of the Handy Music Co., of New York City,
which is the leading firm of its kind among Colored people in the world.
Perry Bradford is composer of the “Crazy Blues” that have made himself,
Mamie Smith and the Okeh phonograph records nationally and
internationally famous.</p>

<p>N. Clark Smith is second to none among American Colored musicians as a
composer of instrumental, especially, band music. For several years he
was band leader of the Tuskegee Institute expert band and also served
for a long period as bandmaster of the famous Old Illinois 8th Regiment.
Today he is Director of Music at the Lincoln High School, Kansas City,
Mo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span></p>

<p>The following list contains the names of some of the leading musicians
who are foremost composers of different lines of music: Mrs. B. Consuelo
Cook, J. E. Dowell, E. Edmonds, W. H. Farrell, Harry Freeman, Jessie L.
Gaynor, A. P. Grant, H. P. Gilbert, L. Godfrey, Nora Douglass Holt,
Edwin F. Hill, E. A. Jackson, Scott Jolpin, E. T. Jenkins, Joe. Jordan,

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE main thing every boy and girl should have or begin to acquire in
early life, and then continue to keep during his manhood or her
womanhood, is a clean, healthy, supple and well-developed muscular body
that is guided and governed by a pure thinking and self-controlling
mind. And such a body is mainly built up and preserved by taking plenty
of out-door playful exercises in early childhood; by taking frequent
parts in athletics games played in a fair and honest way against
friendly rivals while in young manhood and womanhood; and by regularly
and systematically going through a good drill of setting-up exercises,
gymnastics or calisthenics throughout both middle and old age. These
same childhood games and youthful athletic sports have their good
effects upon the young and tender minds by early teaching them courage
in times of facing big odds and developing self-control during the angry
moments of an exciting game when temptations so often come up to strike
an unfair blow or say some mean and rude thing. And these same out-door
activities have their purifying results upon those minds in that they
are nearer to Nature and thereby prompt more Godly thoughts, words and
deeds among such minds than do certain in-door pastimes that are not so
wholesome. No country in the world surpasses America in the general
suppleness in movement, gracefulness of carriage and all-round muscular
development and physical prowess of the bodies belonging to its people.
And the following named records show that American Colored youths have
played large and valuable parts in helping to build up the physical
reputation of the United States that is today recognized as the leading
country in international athletic sports.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">{204}</a></span></p>

<h3>In Football</h3>

<p>W. H. Lewis (one of the ablest Colored lawyers in America today) before
graduating from Harvard proved to be the greatest football center,
Colored or white, in his college and of his time. Every fall when
Harvard now faces her, Brown University heaves a loud sigh of regret
that Fritz Pollard, a Colored All-American Half-back, is not on her
football team to again and mostly alone carry the brown and white
pennant to a crushing victory over the almost unbeatable crimson and
white colors. Williams has since made such a football record at Brown
that he was given a place on an All-American team by the New York World.
It was Johnny Shelbourne, All-American Fullback, who was one of the four
stars on Dartmouth football team that so smoothly steam-rollered the
team of the University of Pa., with a score of 44 to 7 on Franklin
Field, at Philadelphia, Pa., November 13, 1920. Shelbourne is also such
a sprinter that he is able to “fade-away” over a 40 yard stretch in 4
4-5 seconds. Calloway not only made the Varsity team of Columbia but has
proved one of its most valuable men. All football teams that have
recently played against Northwestern University have felt the brawn and
held the weight of “Buddy” Turner. Washington &amp; Jefferson in their
latest football games have fully relied upon the punting toe of their
Colored player, West. Athletic writers and critics on the staffs of both
the Chicago Tribune and Colliers Weekly have given Duke Slater, the Iowa
tackle, a place on an All-Western football team. Leon Taylor was made
All-Ohio Conferee fullback at Oberlin, Ohio. Smith’s tricks of going
completely wild when turned loose on the gridiron of Michigan Agr.
College caused them to put him on an All-American team for safe keeping.
When knocking men right and left on the field of Minnesota University,
Marshall acted so much like a Minnesota Indian on the war path that they
had to do something to sort of tame him down, so they put him on an
All-American team. Beside winning his letters in baseball, basketball
and track athletics, A. Hamblin of Knox College was made captain of his
1918 football team. M. Richmond, on account of his excellent defensive
and offensive playings was made captain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_205" id="page_205">{205}</a></span> Des Moines College 1917
football team. Sol Butler, when playing on the Dubuque College football
team, came in such close contact with and made such lasting impressions
on his opponents that they will until their dying days remember having
met a Sol Butler at some time and at some place. W. E. Morrison and W.
Brown were two of the outstanding stars who played on the Tuft College
varsity eleven at the times it beat Harvard and gave Princeton one of
the toughest battles and one of the worse heart-stop-beating scares it
has ever had on a football field. In New England, the names and pigskin
deeds of those two charging warriors, especially that of Morrison are
still fondly remembered and always referred to with admiration and
pride. Paul Robeson of Rutgers College was made an All-American End.
Walter Camp (white) of Yale University in selecting his All-American
Football Team of 1918 said, “There never was a more serviceable end,
both in attack and defense than Robeson&mdash;the 200 pound giant of Rutgers.
Defensively this team is remarkably strong with Robeson and Alexander
backing up the line as secondary defense; Taking turns at this they
would be employed in a line of work to which they are thoroughly
accustomed and in which they have had no peers in many years.”
(quotation from Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, page 44).
Other Colored youths who have won distinction as football players in
white universities and colleges are; Taylor at the University of Pa.,
Bullock at Dartmouth, Gray and Pinkett at Amherst, Ayler at Brown,
Chadwell at Williams, Craighead at Massachusetts Agri. College, Jones at
Harvard, Ransom at Belout, Young and Wheeler at Illinois, Johnson and
Ross at Nebraska, Tibbs at Syracuse, Green at Western Reserve and
Roberts at Colorado Reserve, Niles at Colby.</p>

<h3>On The Track and Field</h3>

<p>Howard P. Drew, the present holder of the Official A. A. U. world record
of 9 3-5 seconds for 100 yds, was selected in 1918 as a member of the
All-American Athletic Team and in 1919 as a member of the All-American
Track Team. In writing of Drew in the Philadelphia North American of
July 17, 1920, Law<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">{206}</a></span>son Roberston (white) Coach of Athletics at the
University of Pa., said: “Just before Drew broke down eight years ago in
Stockholm he showed enough speed in his trial heat to warrant the belief
that he could beat any man in the final by 3 yards. In the semifinal
heat he “pulled” his tendon when he had covered about 80 yards and
limped in the remainder of the distance. Even at that he won his
semi-final heat by about eight yards from Thomas of Princeton, the 1912
intercollegiate champion.” The following quotation on Drew is extracted
from Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919, page 44: “At the 1918 Western
Conference College Outdoor Track and Field Championship Events, Howard
Drew, the world’s famous sprinter staged a comeback by winning against a
very fast field the 100 and 220 yard dashes. A comment on Drews’
performance said: “By winning the 100 and 220 yard dashes from the
fastest fields that the middle western colleges could boast, Drew
demonstrated that his victories were not due to accident or lack of
formidable opponents. If any further proof were needed, the time would
amply attest the high standard of Drew’s sprinting as he ran the 100 in
10 seconds. When it is taken into consideration that Drew is 28 years of
age and has been competing for thirteen years, during which time he has
won numerous victories and equalled the world’s record time in both of
these events, it can be seen that his latest triumphs are little short
of athletic marvels.”</p>

<p>Beside being one of its best football players, Sol Butler was also one
of the best all-round athletes Dubuque College ever turned out, and was
holder of the American A. A. U. broad jump record of twenty-four feet
and eight inches. In July 1919 Butler (now of Drake College) won the
broad jump in the Inter-Allied Games at Pershing Stadium, France. He was
one of the athletes selected to represent the United States in those
games. Butler also won the broad jump event at the Relay Carnival of the
University of Pa., by leaping 23 feet 5 3-4 inches. Even in his
youngster frolics while attending the Hutchinson, Kan. High School,
Butler showed his unusual speed by getting loose at Evanston, Ill., on
March 28, 1914, and pushing 60 yards of air out of the way in 6 2-5
seconds. When he finally slowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207" id="page_207">{207}</a></span> down at the end of that affair and kept
still long enough to listen he learned those boyhood runaway wild steps
had established the best United States Inter-Scholastic Track Record for
that event.</p>

<h3>Edward Orval Gourdin</h3>

<p>The field sensation among the white colleges during the past two years
has been E. O. Gourdin, the Harvard all-round star athlete. This Colored
athlete is at this writing unquestionably the backbone and mainstay of
the Harvard track team, and throughout their competitions with other
colleges, Gourdin has been in the majority of cases the highest
individual point scorer for his college. And yet, his victories have
been under the most trying conditions and circumstances. Being a star in
many events and the chief one upon whom Harvard depended, in numerous
meets he has repeatedly been called upon to skip from one event to
another and back again without stopping to catch his breath or get a
rest: even fates, especially during the spring of 1921 seeming to be
against him, for it usually rained the day before or the day he had to
perform. As his best work is done on dry ground, and he fully knows it,
his wet, muddy and slippery events were of course entered with a certain
amount of mental depression, but his courage never faltered nor his
willingness halted. During the spring of 1921 when Harvard and Yale met
in their annual track meet, the track was soaked from a former rain;
yet, Gourdin won the 100 yard dash from Yale in 10 2-5 seconds. Although
the runway was uncertain from dampness, the take-off risky for the same
reason and the pit wet from holding rain, he won the broad jump from
Yale by hurling himself through the air 24 feet and 4 inches. In the
shot-put under favorable conditions he clears 41 feet and in the 220
yard dash he hugs 22 seconds so tight that it can’t get away from him.</p>

<h3>Extra! Extra! Extra! Special Delivery Red Rush Telegram!</h3>

<p>At last, fates and the atmospheric elements smiled down upon the Colored
athletic world wonder and marvel, “Ned” Gourdin, by giving him “A
Perfect Day” (no drizzling rains, no wet slippery grounds, no damp heavy
airs) on July 23, 1921.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span> On this date, that hilariously kissed the sun
“good night” and joyously embraced the moon “good morning”, was held a
dual track meet between the Harvard-Yale teams and the Oxford-Cambridge
teams of England, at the Harvard Stadium. Regarding the results of that
meet, the writer quotes the following extracts as part of an article
that, according to the Chicago Defender of July 30, 1921, appeared in
the July 25, 1921 issue of the Boston Daily Post:</p>

<h3>“By Wilton Vaugh”</h3>

<p>“Edward Orval Gourdin now goes down in the Harvard annals as the
greatest track athlete ever to represent the Crimson.</p>

<p>“His record-breaking jump of 25 feet 3 inches in the running broad jump
last Saturday at the stadium international college meet was just a
climax to his amazing achievements on the cinders.</p>

<h3>“Amazing Record”</h3>

<p>“But that particular feat alone would have been enough to rank “Ned”
with the elite of Cambridge, because the world has been waiting twenty
years for a man capable of matching Peter O’Connor’s leap of 24 feet
11¾ inches. The Harvard idol accomplished it, and with such a margin
that it now seems hopeless of developing a greater jumper for a number
of years, anyway.</p>

<p>“His all-round prowess on the track would have been sufficient to rate
him with the best. Had he chosen to specialize in any one of the eight
events it is not beyond the scope of human thought to see him shatter
different marks. His best winning records in the matches he has already
tried are:</p>

<div class="sml85">

<p class="nind4">
100-yard dash&mdash;9 4-5 seconds.<br />
220-yard dash&mdash;22 1-5 seconds.<br />
440-yard run&mdash;52 1-5 seconds.<br />
Running broad jump&mdash;25 feet 3 inches.<br />
Running high jump&mdash;5 feet 9 inches.<br />
Running hop, step and jump&mdash;45 feet 3 inches.<br />
Javelin throw&mdash;140 feet.<br />
Discus throw&mdash;110 feet.<br />
</p>

<p>In the above meet on July 23, 1921 Gourdin also won the 100-yard
dash from his closest rival, Rudd, the famed sprinter and captain
of the British team.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">{209}</a></span></p>

<p>During his athletic career, the late J. B. Taylor of the University of
Pa., was a track wonder in both America and Europe. When in action he
had the easiest and prettiest carriage of body and the smoothest
clocklike movement of limbs of any sprinter seen on the cinder path for
years. When making his 440 yard and other records he used a remarkable
sprinting stride of nine feet&mdash;about two feet longer than the average
sprinter takes.</p>

<p>While at Harvard, T. Cable won fame as a hammer thrower; L. V. Alexis
was a star trackman, and E. L. Davidson won the 125 pound-class
wrestling Collegiate Championship in competing against the best white
wrestlers of his class from the other six big colleges that had entered
the match. A. L. Jackson was one of the best hurdlers Harvard ever
turned out. B. Dismond of the University of Chicago and Lee Umble of
Colorado University made records for their schools, and Umble is today
one of the best wrestlers of his class in the West. J. T. Carter has won
recognition as a crack sprinter on the Brown track team, Dewey Rogers is
a star trackman on the University of Pa. track team and his ability to
push 440 yards back of him in 50 2-5 seconds shows he has a pair of
heels that must be closely watched or they may some day on some cinder
path get fast ideas to elope from their owner. Rogers in one of his 440
yards sprints defeated the captain of his own track team&mdash;Earl Eby.</p>

<p>Roy Morris has won a national reputation as a sprinter of note. R. E.
Johnson of Pittsburgh, is one of the best 5,000 and 10,000 meter runners
in the country. Little Charley Mitchell of the St. Christopher Club, New
York, is one of the pluckiest and ablest marathon runners in the land
and has finished eighth out of a string of sixty. G. L. Brashear, now
coach of Straight University, New Orleans, La., was at one time one of
the best all-round athletes in California. E. Niles has repeatedly shown
that he is one of the best 440 and 880 yard sprinters in New England.</p>

<p>“The New York Athletic Club games saw another promising Negro athlete
come into prominence. Billy Parker, representing the St. Christopher
Club, raced to an easy victory in the 1,000 yard run. He won about as he
pleased in 2:10. Parker<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span> is one of the best-looking runners that the
Colored clubs have developed in years. He is big, rangy, and a good
strider.” The above is what Howard Valentine, a sport writer, had to say
in a white paper, the New York Globe, about Wm. S. (Billy) Parker who so
easily defeated some of the fastest Colored and white runners in the
East. Parker is also one of the foremost basketball players in the East.
Young men who are interested in bicycle riding might be encouraged to
learn here that little Major Taylor, a Colored man, during the year 1900
held the championship as the fastest bicycle rider in America.</p>

<h3>Howard and Lincoln at the University of Pennsylvania</h3>

<p>At the University of Pa., Relay Games held April 29 and 30, 1921, on
Franklin Field, Phila., Pa., the Howard University track team took a one
mile relay race away from Bowdoin College, Carnegie School of
Technology, Tufts College and several other white colleges of that
stamp. The Lincoln University track team in a one mile relay race also
romped away from the teams of George Washington University and a number
of other such white institutions.</p>

<p>Beside gaining honors in winning those only two events in which they
were entered, each of these two Colored teams was presented with a
banner and each member of the teams was given a gold watch. The outcome
of those two events not only brought encouragements to athletes in all
Negro schools and pride to members of the Race throughout the country,
but it convinced the athletic world of two truths. First, the
brotherhood and true sportsmanship feelings between white and Colored
schools in America are slowly but surely increasing and becoming closer
and more friendly. Secondly, Negro universities, colleges and schools
are today turning out athletes who can hold their own when competing
with athletes developed by white schools of the same class.</p>

<h3>Colored Athletes in Colored Universities and Colleges.</h3>

<p>Those Colored youths mentioned in the preceding chapter are but a few of
the Colored athletes who while attending white schools successfully
matched the stamina, endurance and strength of their muscles, bones and
will powers against those of Caucasian youths. The following named
Colored athletes are those who studied and competed among themselves in
Colored Universities, colleges and schools under instructions of their
college trained Colored Athletic coaches, and who would have carried
away many athletic first honors had they attended white schools and
taken parts in sports:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Atlanta University&mdash;L. R. Harper, all-round star athlete: L. D.
Maxwell, football and baseball star; W. S. Fuller, basketball star.</p>

<p>Fisk University:&mdash;H. A. Johnson, all-round star athlete; W. H.
Zeigler, football star; L. O. McVey, baseball star.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span></p>

<p>Hampton Institute:&mdash;James Gayle, all-round star athlete; J. E.

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">C</span>ris Terriente, Colored champion home-run hitter and out-fielder, and
known as the Cuban “Babe Ruth”, was a marvel even several years ago when
he played in the United States with the famous Colored teams, American
Giants of Chicago and the All-Nationals of Kansas City. This Colored
ball player has been frequently estimated by white baseball critics as
being an equal home-run hitter to the celebrated “Babe Ruth”, whose
services were sold by a Boston team to a New York team for over one
hundred thousand dollars. And one of those well-meaning white critics,
when commenting on the wonderful baseball playing of Terriente, so far
forgot his “square-deal” and one hundred per cent Americanism as to
allow some of his grayless brain matter and stagnant watery thoughts to
soak through his system and overflow into his pen point that splashed
little puddles of poisoned ink. In his article he lamented the fact that
it was impossible to “indelibly white-wash” Terrente so as to make him
white enough to be accepted as a playing member on one of the Big League
White baseball teams.</p>

<p>Now, if that same baseball critic had entered the United States Army as
either a volunteer or a draftee in the World War and had been dying of
thirst on the bloodsoaked and bone-strewn plains of “No Man’s Land”, it
is wondered if he would have thought it necessary to “indelibly
white-wash” Colored soldiers before accepting from their black lips, and
greedily pressing to his own parched white lips, the begged-for water
canteens of the Colored soldiers? For such exchanges of canteens between
generous Colored and dying white soldiers occurred thousands of times
and in not one instance did those famished white men allow color
prejudice to stand between them and a few mouthsfuls of left-over
Colored water that meant the saving of their lives. Nevertheless, a
majority of those soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">{214}</a></span> whose lives had been saved by the timely
swallows of water from the canteens of black soldiers, immediately
resumed their persecution of and discriminations against the Negro race
even before they got back home to America.</p>

<p>Thus while history shows that the majority of white people, when in the
jaws of threatened or actual death, become too “color-blind” and
“near-sighted” to see the hue of the hand or the shape of the face that
comes to its help and vital rescue; history also shows that a great many
white people, while in the pink of life, health and prosperity, allow
their visions to become so magnified and their minds to become so
overrun and soaked with vile race prejudice that they constantly see
imaginary color-lines that really do not exist. They also are constantly
building up before law-abiding, clean-living and progressive classes of
Colored people certain racial barriers that are not only proving a stain
but also a shame (in the eyes of the rest of the onlooking world) upon
this land of freedom, civilization and Christianity. But at this time
and place the writer will not go further into this particular phase of
this color-line subject, as it is being more fully dealt with in the
writing of one of his other books.</p>

<p>Fair-minded white people are justly ashamed of the words and actions of
such members of their race as the above mentioned reporter, and already
bright rays of hope are beginning to shine in the Big League for Colored
baseball players. In this direction The Continental League with
headquarters at Boston, Mass. and formed by the white baseball magnate,
Andrew Lawson, has really wedged the first opening. At the formation of
this league, Lawson admitted two Colored teams, one from Providence, R.
I. and the other from Boston, the latter team having both Colored and
white players. This is the greatest bit of encouragement Colored
professional baseball players in America have ever received. The
chairman of the Board of Directors of The Continental League is R. T.
Murray, a Colored man. This league’s influence for the spreading of
broad-mindedness and fair-play is already being noticed among the
officials of other white Big Leagues. At the end of the baseball season
of 1920,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span> Colored teams were allowed to play against many of the big
white league teams on their barn-storming tours.</p>

<p>During that season Bolden’s Hilldale team played against Connie Mack’s
team of All-Stars at the National League Park, Phila., Pa., in which
game Bolden’s team lost by a score of 2 to 1.</p>

<p>Bolden’s team also played against the famous “Babe” Ruth and his
All-Stars at the National League Park, Phila., Pa., in which game
Bolden’s team won by a score of 5 to 0. In this game, Flourney the
Hilldale pitcher not only kept “Babe” Ruth from getting one of his
famous home-runs but struck him out twice. “Babe” Ruth was also struck
out at Shibe Park, Phila., Pa., during the same season by “Cannon Ball”
Redding, star pitcher on the Atlantic City Bacharach Giants team.</p>

<p>Tesreau’s Bears played against Carl May’s All Stars at Dyckman Oval at
which place the Yankees defeated the Colored team on both ends of a
double-header by scores of 10 to 0 and 5 to 3.</p>

<p>The Lincoln Colored Giants played and defeated the New York Giants
(white) in New York by a score of 4 to 1. Williams the Colored pitcher
struck out thirteen men on the white team.</p>

<p>As far back as the early eighties, M. F. Walker proved himself such a
good pitcher that he played on a white league ball team in Toledo, Ohio,
and a Frank Grant also played on big white league teams in Connecticut,
New York and Pennsylvania. William B. Matthews, during his college days
at Harvard caused quite a sensation throughout the country by his
unexcelled ball playing and mainly through his star playing his college
nine won sweeping victories all down the line of their engagements.</p>

<p>In taking hurried glances over past performances of present day Colored
baseball players, the following named are but a few picked from among
those who think, dream, talk and act so much over the diamond that
baseball has become their middle names:</p>

<p>T. Brown of American Giants, Cockerell and Flourney of Hilldale, Holland
of Detroit Stars, Leblanc of Cuban Stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">{216}</a></span> Redding of Bacharach Giants,
Rogan of St. Louis Giants and J. Williams of Lincoln Giants put forth
the same kind of energy and earnestness in making moundmen fan the wind
and think holes are in their bats as did Mathewson, Shawkey and
Alexander, the great white pitchers, against their players.</p>

<p>Duncan of Chicago Giants, Ray of Kansas City Monarchs, Rodguez of
Cincinnati Stars, Rojo of Bacharach Giants, Santop of Hilldale Quakers
and Webster of Detroit Stars use the same kind of stickability in
freezing onto hot balls as the white past masters in backstop, Schalk
and O’Neill.</p>

<p>Bost of Oakland Braves, Grant of American Giants, Jeffries of Chicago
Giants, Pettus of Bacharach Giants and Richards of Godfrey’s California
All-Stars go through the same kind of successful limber-jointed
jumping-jack antics on first base as McInnis and Kelly in the big white
leagues.</p>

<p>Crowell of Tesreau Bears, Holloway of Indianapolis A. B. C’s. Holtz of
St. Louis Giants and Thomas of Columbus Buckeyes have the same love for
and show just as much jealously over the second bag as the crack second
basemen, Collins and Hornsby don’t try to hide.</p>

<p>Day of Indianapolis A. B. C’s, Dinan of Tesraeu Bears, Fial of Lincoln
Giants, Francis of Hilldale Quakers, Brown of Norfolk Giants and F. Hill
of Detroit Stars are just as busy nailing and crucifying the last hopes
of runners at third base as Groh and Gardner, who are about the best
among white third basemen.</p>

<p>Dobbins of Hilldale Quakers, Hewitt of St. Louis Giants, Lloyd of
Columbus Buckeyes and Lundy of Bacharach Giants while panning the same
kind of red-hot frying sizzlers at shortstop as the celebrated Wagner
and Bancroft, also usually salt and pepper those frying sizzlers with
most amusing capers and comedian stage acts.</p>

<p>Briggs of Hilldale Quakers, Gans of Lincoln Giants, P. Hill of Detroit
Stars, Jenkins of Chicago Giants, Kemp of Norfolk Giants, Thomas of
Baltimore Black Sox, and Weeks of Pitts<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217">{217}</a></span>burgh Stars have that same knack
of vamping the sun straight in the face without blinking an eye while
pulling down a twenty-two story sky-scrapping fly, like the rangy
outfielders Speaker and Burns.</p>

<p>Meadows of Godfrey’s California All-Stars, Santop of Hilldale Quakers
and Torrenti of American Giants are just as much interested in astronomy
and scientific research as “Babe” Ruth and Sisler when they start a
message to the planet Mars by way of a home-run baseball.</p>

<p>While big Jeff Tesreau has tried so hard and done so well, he has not
yet become so big a thief as Ty Cobb in stealing bases and pawning runs
at home-plate.</p>

<p>All of the other players, on these Colored teams, whose names have not
been mentioned are also A-1 baseball jugglers and would make good
showing to their credits in any of the white Big Leagues that would give
them a fair and square chance to play on their teams.</p>

<p>And Colored boys who are talented and aspire to become great ball
players should not lose ambition and hang back because of their race or
color: They should take on new courage by reading here; that the most
youthful and hopeful things (the grass and leaves) in the world, are
Colored, and no one who looks “green” with hate and envy is able to stop
Dame Nature each spring from stepping boldly out and, without apologies
to men of any race, drapping the woods and fields with her colored
shades of green.</p>

<p>Among Colored schools, Hampton, Howard and Lincoln form the big
basket-ball right-angle triangle whose three angles each year are
usually so constantly and rapidly twisted and turned to equal elevations
of degrees, that it is not until the end of the season, when the
three-sided affair finally settles on a steady foundation, that the
spectators are really able to see and tell the base of this triangle
from its hypothenuse and altitude.</p>

<p>Johnny Johnson, the Colored right-forward on the Columbia University
varsity basketball team, in playing against the teams of Harvard, Yale,
Dartmouth, Pennsylvania and other big colleges, in nearly every case
scored the majority of points for his college team. His playing against
these colleges was so brainy, spectacular and effective that it caused
the leading white sport pages to give him glowing compliments relative
to his being one of the best basketball players in the country.</p>

<p>In several large cities Colored athletes have organized and wonderfully
developed some of the swiftest and most efficient basketball teams in
America. Among the leading teams are: Dr. Johnson’s Forty Club of
Chicago, Cum Posey’s Loendi Club of Pittsburgh, Chas. Bradford’s St.
Christopher Club of New York, Manager Accoe’s A. C. Lightning Five of
Brooklyn, C. Cain’s Vandals, of Atlantic City, “Babe” Thomas’ Alpha Big
Five of New York, Douglas’ Spartan Braves of New York, Moss’ Center Five
of Toledo, Ohio, All-Scholastics of Harrisburg, the Alcoes of
Washington, D.C., the Athenians of Baltimore and the Pioneers of
Cleveland, Ohio.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span></p>

<p>Among those players on these teams whose names, through observation and
information, the writer was able to get are: Betts, Blueitt, Sol Butler,
Brown, Bundy, Capers, Cooper, Duff, Fial, Fields, Forbes, Gumbs, Howard,
Hubbard, Jenkins, Moss Posey, Ricks, Sessons, Slocum, Young and Winters.
The other players on these teams were always doing such tricky feinting
dizzy ducking, dazzling dodging, sudden blocking, slippery sliding,
magic dribbling, lightning shooting and bull’s eye caging that the
writer was not able to corner them in, so as to trip them up and hold
them down long enough to get their names.</p>

<span class="smcap">“Jack” Johnson.</span></h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Talk as you may of his private life;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">“Jack” led the world in fistic strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Johnson today has as keen a sense<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As any new man in self-defense.<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The decisions the United States Government made during the World War,
regarding the urgent necessity of including boxing in its all-round
training in preparing the soldiers and sailors for war, at last brought
the art of self-defense into its own and accorded it the proper
recognition and value it should have officially received years ago. In
private life prize fighting had its followers in both America and Europe
as far back as a hundred years ago. About that time a Virginia Negro
slave by the name of Tommy Molineaux whipped all American boxers who met
him after which he went to Europe where he was beaten by the Englishman,
Cribb, who was at that time the champion of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Along in the 70’s, George Godfrey was in his prime and became known on
both sides of the ocean on account of whipping the famous white fighter,
Lannon, in one of the greatest prize fights ever “pulled off” in New
England. Godfrey fought seventy-six rounds with the great fighter, Jake
Kilrain and he also staid twenty rounds with the “Australian Black
Wildcat,” Peter Jackson. As John L. Sullivan, known as the greatest
white slugger of all times, was then in his prime and zenith, Godfrey
repeatedly tried to meet him in the ring but Sullivan always managed to
evade a fight with him.</p>

<p>Peter Jackson, although an Australian by birth, spent his best fighting
years in America. He fought with, came out even or on top of all the
best men of his days. It was he who fought a 61 round draw with James J.
Corbett, who is known as the most scientific heavyweight champion boxer
the world has ever seen. Jackson was considered by many as the quickest
heavyweight foot worker in the game. It is said that he was so uncanny
quick on his feet that many times when an opponent made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span> lunge at him,
Jackson would dodge the blow, circle to the rear of the fighter and pin
him one back of the ear before the opponent could regain his balance,
face around and throw up his guard to block off the blow. During all the
time he was meeting the best heavyweights, Jackson held out a standing
challenge to John L. Sullivan, who never would meet him in the ring. But
John L. was always truthful enough to admit that he did not consider
himself champion of the world because he had never whipped Peter
Jackson. (for proof of this statement write to the Editor of Everybody’s
Column, Philadelphia Inquirer, Phila., Pa.) According to an article that
appeared in the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin of January 26, 1921, and
which was written by Hughey Fullerton a white sport critic, John L.
Sullivan also side stepped another Colored heavyweight prize fighter,
who was known in Louisiana as “Black Zeke”. This “Zeke” who weighed 220
pounds and was six feet two inches tall, could lift a bale of cotton
weighing five hundred pounds. In reference to this fighter a paragraph
in the above mentioned article read as follows: “After the
Sullivan-Kilrain fight Mr. Carrol tried to arrange a bout between “Zeke”
and John L. The latter refused and the planter followed Sullivan over
the country, but to no avail.” So while Sullivan was truthfully champion
over the world of white fighters, there were at least three Colored
fighters, George Godfrey, Peter Jackson and “Black Zeke” over whom John
L. never was champion, because he had never whipped any one of them
although all three had repeatedly followed and challenged him after they
had met and held their own with the other best men of their times.</p>

<p>Of all prize fighters, Colored or white, the world has ever known,
George Dixon was declared the most wonderful of them all. Being a little
over four feet tall, weighing less then 130 pounds, with small tapering
legs that seemed to sweat tears of pain under the weight of his gigantic
chest and unusually broad shoulders from which dangled muscular arms of
such thickness and length that they looked unnatural, Dixon presented a
most uncanny and formidable foe when stripped in the ring waiting for
action. He always proved just as formidable as he looked;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_222" id="page_222">{222}</a></span> for when he
warmed up and got into real action, it seemed to his opponent that Mr. &amp;
Mrs. Satan and their entire brood of little Satan imps from Hades had
been turned loose in the ring. During a period of ten years (1890-1900)
Dixon at different times held both the Bantamweight and Featherweight
championships of the world. And one of the main reasons why his name
will ever go down in ring history as the “Wonder of Wonders” is that he
did something no other world champion has ever done&mdash;he “came back”
three times and regained his lost championship. It is said that he made
a record of over a thousand clean knockouts during his fighting career.
His three “Come backs” were staged as follows: Benny Jordan took the
title from him and he regained it from Eddie Santry; Frankie Erne gave
Dixon a good spanking one year and the next year he thrashed that same
Frankie Erne; Sol Smith gave him a good lacing, and the same year, Dixon
in a return battle took back his title and in doing so (to use a
frequent and amusing expression of one “Tommy” Howard, a jolly fellow
and Virginia old-time friend of the writer’s) “nearly shook the living
life out of him.”</p>

<p>Because Dixon always went into the squared-circle to give his best in
manhood fighting and not his worse in childhood playing and faking, he
was respected and beloved by fight fans of all classes and colors, which
was proved by the most celebrated sport followers of the day, including
ex-Heavy-weight Champion James J. Corbett, acting as pallbearers at his
funeral.</p>

<p>Joe Walcott and Dixie Kid were two other great little fighters and they
both became Welterweight world Champions, Walcott from 1901 to 1904 and
Dixie Kid from 1904 to 1908. It is said of these two fighters, that,
like Dixon, they became famous in their readiness to meet top-notch
fighters who were nearly twice their height and weight. When they could
get such big men in the ring with them, they usually jumped clear off
the floor to land a mighty crushing paw upon some rival’s tempting jaw
that then and there felt nothing more.</p>

<p>But the “Old Master” of them all, who even today is conceded to have
been one of if not the cleanest hitting, quickest moving, gamest staying
and most scientific boxers, Colored or white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223">{223}</a></span> big or little, who ever
one-stepped, two-stepped, waltzed and Virginia-reeled into and around a
roped-circle, was the ring’s national favorite, Joe Cans of Baltimore,
Md. This great little fighter, who was as much a pet of the white
sporting faction as of the Colored element, took the Lightweight
championship away from Frank Erne in 1892 and kept it for six years.
During that time he defeated all the best men in his field and jumped
over the fence into the Welterweight pastures where he gored and tossed
into the air several human beings and caused many to climb up on the
fence in order to keep out of his way, until they saw that his constant
mad rushes had weakened his stamina and tore down his system. It was
during the zenith of his fighting career that whenever Gans started from
home to engage in a fight his mother would laughingly say, “Bring home
the bacon, Joe.” The boy fully understood and appreciated his mother’s
encouraging joke and never returned home, when in his prime, without
bringing along the winner’s roll of money. Joe Gans was as game as any
game rooster that ever threw defiant crows from a barnyard gate and when
he was in great need of money, to get a fight he would make such
vitality sapping and strength weakening weights that people wondered how
he was able to stand up much less jump around and fight. And to the very
last, poor, broken-bodied, but not broken spirited, Joe Gans put up one
of the gamest losing battles ever fought against that greatest
champion&mdash;of all times among all peoples&mdash;Death.</p>

<p>“Panama Joe Gans” a Colored fighter of today has added laurels to the
name he has adopted by becoming Middleweight Champion. Like his late
namesake he is willing at all times to give the best of them in and out
of his class chances to win his title. Just because he is a champion he
does not draw the “color line” against any white fighter but fights as
often as four and five times a month with his championship at stake
every time.</p>

<p>Other Colored fighters who were among the best in their times and who no
doubt would have won championships in and out of their classes, had the
“color lines” not been drawn around them, are; Bob Armstrong, Jack
Blackburn, Bobbie Dobbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">{224}</a></span> Sam Hopkins, Young Peter Jackson, Joe
Jeanette, Sam Langford, Sam McVey and Fred Morris.</p>

<p>Some of the present day Colored fighters who are most frequently heard
about are Jeff Clark, Leo Johnson, Jamaica Kid, Kid Norfolk, Benny
Ponteau, Bill Tate, Jack Thompson, Jack White and Harry Wills,
challenger and dreaded foe of Dempsey.</p>

<p>From 1908 to 1914 the world heavyweight champion fighter was Jack
Johnson, the only Colored man who ever wore that crown of ring glory and
belt of fighting fame. Unlike any of the white heavyweight champions,
Johnson won the title twice: first from Tommy Burns in 1908 and secondly
on that memorial Fourth of July 1910, from Jim Jefferies, who along with
the American public disputed Jack’s right to the title. After his
complete whipping of Jefferies, the Colored fighter, proved to the
entire world that he was not only the rightful holder of the title but
that he was also one of the best champions the ring had ever seen.
Because of his having the pantherlike movements and quickness of a Peter
Jackson, the straight-arm punch of a John L. Sullivan, the scientific
hit-and-get-away style of a James J. Corbett, the ring generalship and
craftiness of a “Bob” Fitzsimmons and the gameness and stamina of a
“Jim” Jefferies, plus his own level-headedness and cheerful fighting
disposition, the best fight critics in America and Europe considered
“Jack” Johnson when in his prime, as being the best all-round and
equally balanced heavyweight fighter who ever crawled through the ropes
to battle in a prize ring.</p>

<p>Regarding the Johnson-Willard fight in Havana, Cuba, at which time the
heavyweight title passed from Johnson to Willard the writer quotes here
an extract that is taken from the article, “Jack Johnson Tells The
Truth” that was written by Juli Jones, Jr. in the August 6, 1921 issue
of The Chicago Defender.</p>

<p>“The sporting editor of the New York Sun printed an article which stated
that Jack Johnson said the Willard fight was on the level; that he did
not lay down to Willard in Havana, Cuba. This statement coming from
Johnson, printed in one of America’s first-class dailies, is the first
good step that Johnson has taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">{225}</a></span> to win the favor of the real sporting
public. The present public will not stand for a crook or a bad loser. It
killed Fred Fulton, a very likable man.</p>

<p>“Johnson in part made it quite plain when he stated if he was going to
lay down to Willard he would have done so in the seventh or ninth round,
and not wait until the twenty-sixth to flop. He also stated he had
always fought square and that was the reason he got to the top. Johnson
gives a good reason for his failure to whip Willard, a very good reason.
First, he had underestimated Willard, hadn’t proper training, ran around
on the ocean looking for a battle ground. These had their effects on the
fight.”</p>

<p>Throughout his marvelous fighting career, Johnson was climbing to
success under most unfavorable conditions. White fighters in winning
championships have only to fight against and beat down the opponent in
the ring before them. But before he even got a chance to fight for the
titled belt, “Jack” had always to mentally fight race prejudice on the
outside of the ring at the same time he was physically beating down his
white opponent in the ring. It would be hard to find proper words to
describe the great fistic career Johnson would have made for himself if
he had received the same kind of unprejudiced encouragements and
boostings all white champions receive. And if up to this date nearly one
hundred million of white Americans consider it wonderful to have
produced out of that number seven white heavyweight champion
fighters&mdash;Sullivan, Corbett, Fitzsimmons, Jefferies, Burns, Willard, and
Dempsey; or in other words a champion for ever fourteen million of their
population: then it must be most wonderful that less than thirteen
million of Colored Americans, under most unfair and persecuting
conditions, have produced one heavyweight champion fighter of the
world&mdash;John Arthur (“Jack”) Johnson.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those people who, on account of their jealousy and
envy of Johnson’s fighting ability, try to defame and lower his
character to the lowest, the writer would suggest the reading of the
logic article&mdash;“Jack Johnson, Self-Made Man” that was written in the May
15, 1920 issue of the Chicago Defender by the able sport scribe, Juli
Jones, Jr. The following is an extract from that article:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span></p>

<p>“Both races got Jack wrong. His aim in life was not to be a doctor,
preacher, lawyer or Race Leader. He set out to be the best man with his
fists, which he did beyond all question of doubt. We cannot find one
case where Jack ruined any young girl’s future or broke up any man’s
happy home; neither was he mixed up in any barroom fights. Never was he
found in the gutter drunk or making a disgraceful fellow of himself,
throwing away his money. On the other hand, since Jack has been
self-exiled from his country, press reports from England, France, Spain
and Mexico tell us that he has conducted himself in the most gentlemanly
way and is welcome back in their countries at any time. How many, men
who have been born under any flag could have stood what Jack has stood
for the past six or eight years and still be in the limelight, handing
the world a golden smile, saying, “Good will to all men.”</p>

<p>Now, not for one moment is the writer, in dealing with this subject,
attempting to shield or cover-up any short-comings that may have occured
in the private life of Jack Johnson. But, if after reading the above
quotation there still be those people who continue to sneer at and
belittle the upward struggles and crowning success of this professional
fighter, the writer would kindly suggest that each one of such people
ask himself or herself the following question:</p>

<p>Have I (with all my good birth, pleasant and elevating home life, early
encouragements, full privileges, unnumbered opportunities, unchecked
enthusiasms, unshaken determinations, wide preparations, various
abilities, friendly boostings and perfect living) ever stood for one
whole day upon the top round of world recognized success in my chosen
life work; as “Jack” Johnson stood for six years on the top round of
world recognized success in his self-selected life calling?</p>

<p>Thus far have Colored athletes pushed onward. But the following are a
few mentioned fields of athletics in which Colored youths have not
become very active or efficient mainly because of the lack of certain
facilities and sufficient appliances and accommodations for proper and
seasonable trainings.</p>

<p>Rowing crews have not been developed in any of the Colored universities,
colleges and schools to any outside recognized extent. This fact is
quite explainable and excusable when it is taken into consideration that
few of these institutions are located near natural and adequate bodies
of water for such purposes. Bordentown School, Bordentown, N.J. and
Hampton Institute, Hampton, Va., are perhaps the two most favorable
exceptions in this case. Both of these schools have peaceful streams of
gurgling waters that flow so near as to softly caress the oft kissed
lips of their water-edged lawns.</p>

<p>Calmly setting upon the banks of the Hampton River, an arm of the
Merrimac-Monitor famed-Hampton Roades, Hampton Institute has running
before its very doors a half mile of nearly straight and unusually
smooth body of water that is wide enough to float at least three crews
abreast. Peacefully nestling on a high projecting hill, Bordentown
School can look miles either way upon the historical Delaware as it
gently flows below making a wide, graceful bend from upward Trenton to
downward Camden.</p>

<p>There are already hopeful signs appearing which show that both of these
institutions in the near future will take full advantages of their
natural and wonderful water facilities by developing rowing crews that
some day will be second to none in the country. By the time this stage
of their rowing development<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228">{228}</a></span> has been reached, it is hoped that the
racial, and sportsmanship feelings between white and Colored colleges
will have become so brotherly and peacefully allied, that, the rowing
crews of Annapolis will be friendly competing against Hampton oarsmen,
and the shellmen of Princeton will be friendly churning the Delaware
waters against the crews of the Bordentown School. And when such times
do come about, the writer feels sure that the oarsmen of Hampton and
Bordentown will guarantee to keep enough water between themselves
(either at the bow or stern) and the shells of Annapolis and Princeton
to wash away and keep down any waves of “color line” that might suddenly
arise to dampen the sportsmanship and one-hundred percent Americanism
atmosphere of the occasions.</p>

<h2><a name="SWIMMING" id="SWIMMING"></a>SWIMMING<br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Diving-Treading-Floating.</span></h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I worship this my hobby’s call,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And all youths ought to learn it all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In water that is deep and wet<br /></span>

<p>General swimming as a recreation and pastime by the Colored people in
the United States has in the past been sadly neglected for some
excusable and some unexcusable reasons. The chief excusable reasons have
been that with few exceptions they have not had access to the places
where they could indulge in this sport and that they did not have the
money with which to promote and construct such places for themselves.
The main, unexcusable reason has been that they, with but few
exceptions, were too timid and scared of drowning to enter water deep
enough and stay there long enough to learn how to swim.</p>

<p>For instance, the writer several years ago made personal investigations
among many Colored fishermen, oystermen and crabmen who live along the
shores of and spend the biggest part of their lives on the Chesapeake
Bay in little boats that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_229" id="page_229">{229}</a></span> year are numerously overturned by sudden
squalls and storms. And to his great and painful surprise he learned
from those men themselves that the majority of them could not swim a
stroke, while among those who had learned to swim, but few had
confidence enough in themselves to believe they could even swim a half
or one mile. And yet those men daily risked their lives and ventured out
upon that deep and uncertain body of water without attempting to revive
and develop that valuable and necessary instinct that is born in every
human being and every dumb animal. As the result of such thoughtless
neglect of their own personal welfare, many of those cheerful, honest,
frugal, hard-working, plain-living and law-abiding people are drowned
each year because of their not knowing how to swim.</p>

<p>But today, through the cities’ public recreation ponds being opened to
Colored youths, the increased erections of Y. M. C. A.’s and Y. W. C.
A.’s of the Colored branches with modernly inclosed pools, Colored
universities, colleges and large schools gradually constructing
gymnasiums containing up-to-date natatoriums, and business men of the
Race buying and improving seashore hotel resorts with beach bathing
privileges such as Dale’s at Cape May, N. J., Bay Shore near Old Point
Comfort, Va., Fitzgerald and Ovington Hotels and Walls’ beach at
Atlantic City, N. J., and Idlewild, Ill., a new interest in learning the
art of swimming is being increasingly aroused among Colored people
throughout America. When fine swimming centers such as the Chicago
Wabash Avenue Y. M. C. A. puts before its Race boys the placards and
advertisements&mdash;“One Thousand Boys Wanted To Learn How To Swim”, it
shows that Colored swimming instructors are using every persuasive means
to get their youths interested and skilled in this most useful and
refreshing pastime. These teachers fully realize that when their art is
rightly learned and properly performed it not only brings into exercise
practically every muscle of the body but also enables its possessor when
necessary to save his own as well as the lives of others. Thus, with
these encouragements, interests, facilities, privileges and proper
instructions rapidly increasing; it is not “building castles in the air”
to prophesy that within a reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230" id="page_230">{230}</a></span> length of time the Negro race in
America will produce a Colored Norman Ross and a Colored Ethelda
Bliebtry as champion swimmers.</p>

<p>The writer recently received from Mr. Chas. H. Williams, Head of the
Physical Culture Department of Hampton Institute, a graduate of that
institution as well as Harvard University and one of the most successful
Colored athletic directors in the country, official letters and
architectural drawings relative to a campaign having already been
launched by Hampton Institute to raise funds for the construction of a
thirty thousand dollar modernly equipped athletic field. When this
pioneer movement for Negro field sports is completed and opened for
general inspection and national track meets; it will then, as the Mecca
in America for Colored field sports, most certainly arouse unbounded
interests, inspirations and determinations in the minds of visitors from
other Colored schools that do not possess such advantages. And as those
visitors turn homeward bound their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232">{232}</a></span> enthusiasms are going to be elevated
to such high and lasting hopes and longings that they will dreamingly
hear, until materially heeded, conscience voices from the clouds above
that will softly and encouragingly whisper; “Go thou likewise and do the
same.” Thus a real athletic dawn will eventually light up and spread
over many Negro schools in such ways as to enable them in due time to
turn out athletes who will surprise the world by making unheard-of and
unbelievable new track records. For instance, as Edward O. Gourdin, the
Colored and greatest track athlete Harvard University has ever had, did
July 23, 1921 at the Harvard Stadium when, in competing against Great
Britain’s best athletes, he made a new running broad jump world record
by leaping 25 feet 3 inches. In making that wonderful jump he beat Peter
O’Connor’s then world record of 24 feet 11¾ inches that track
athletes all over the world for the past 20 years had repeatedly tried
but always failed to beat until Gourdin, a Negro, came along and did the
trick by over a clear margin of 3 inches.</p>

<p>After reading the foregoing pages of Negro success in athletics, Colored
youths have every right to become inspired to redouble their efforts in
trying to win even more first places along these lines. But if a Colored
athlete should at any time just before entering a severe, critical and
history making contest suddenly become discouraged and heavy-hearted,
because of his race and color; he should remember that:&mdash;</p>

<p>The swiftest and most valuable piece of horse-flesh in the world
(Man-O-War) is not white, but is a light-red bay, and from the firm
tread of his feet, prancing swing of his legs, proud carriage of his
body, beautiful arch of his neck, graceful poise of his head, and
fearless look in his eyes, shows he is neither ashamed of his horsehood
nor his well-colored natural coat. So this three-year-old colt did not
fret and worry about his brunette complexion nor the odds in years
against him as he nearly divorced his body from his shadow in winning
the Canadian race that gave him the title, “King of the turf”,
seventy-five thousand dollars in money, and a five thousand dollar gold
cup that otherwise would have gone to the four-year-old British colt,
Sir Barton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_233" id="page_233">{233}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">R</span>EINOLD Wolf, (white) one of the leading stage critics of today, wrote
of Bert Williams as being “The greatest comedian on the American Stage.”
Years back this noted actor was a partner in the famous “Abyssinia”
Williams &amp; Walker Company. For several years he has been a star actor in
The Zeigfield Follies, a leading white high-class Vaudeville Company.
The instant that Williams appears before the footlights, whether he
moves, stands still or doesn’t do either, he captures his audience, and
when with a word-speaking look, a suggestive motion and a life-pictured
song he is always able to bring down a most dignified house in
uproarious laughter; it is no wonder that he has been titled the Harry
Lauder of the Negro race. For years the Columbia Phonograph Co., has
been reproducing Mr. Williams’ songs on their records that are in great
demand, especially his ever-popular songhit “Parson Eatmore”.</p>

<p>Aida Overton Walker, at the time of her death, was mentioned by some of
the New York papers as having been the Lillian Russell of the Negro
race. Appearing first as a chorus dancer in “Isham’s Octoroons” she
through untiring and ceaseless work improved her acting until she
reached her highest dancing feature in the interpretation of “Salome”,
which acting was said to have been of a Mary Garden standard. In their
primes and times, Aida and her talented husband, George Walker were the
dancing Castles of that period, and no couple, Colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span> or white, before
or since, have been able to excel them in their world-famed “Cake Walks”
that they executed by invitation before most of the kings and queens in
Europe. Her singing of “Why Adam Sinned”, “It’s Hard to Love Somebody
When Somebody Don’t Love You”, and “If You Ain’t Got No Money, Well, You
Needn’t Come Around”, had not been equaled by any singer in that line
until our present and famous Mamie Smith first daintly tripped forth and
with those hypnotizing smiles of hers caused the audience to quiver and
tremble from the crown of its head to the sole of its feet while
listening to her life-action singings of “That Thing Called Love”, “You
Can’t Keep a Good Man Down” and “It’s Right Here For You.”</p>

<p>George Walker, the one-time partner of Bert Williams and the late
husband of Aida Walker, was the real “Bon Bon Buddy” singer and starred
with Williams in “Sons of Ham”, “Bandanna Land”, “In Dahomey” etc. “Bob”
Cole, as leader of the renowned Cole and Johnson Company, won a great
deal of his stage glory in the presentation of “The Red Moon”. As well
as an actor he was a composer of note and among his best productions
that attracted wide attention and afforded much amusement for the
theatre goers were “A Shoo Fly Regiment”, “Katydid” and “I Must Have
Been A Dreaming.”</p>

<p>Before going any further mention ought to be made of the world-famed Ira
Aldridge, who was born in Bel Air, Maryland in 1810 and therefore can be
rightly classed as an American product, although he spent most of his
years and died in Europe. Even today he is considered as one of the
greatest actors the Negro race has ever had. Going to Europe when young
and studying at Glasgow University, Scotland, he excelled in composition
work and won many prizes. Winning one success after another, he finally
reached his zenith in the playing of Othello, the Moor. From that time
until his death he was without a peer in portraying that character, and
few have equaled him since. His acting was infused with so much
intelligence, personality, naturalness and composure that he was always
assured of over-crowded theatres and was constantly entertained and
awarded gold medals of honor by the crowned rulers of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span> Prussia,
Austria, Russia and many other important countries in Europe. As Mr.
Aldridge made his home in London, his widow and two talented daughters,
Luranah A. Aldridge, a contralto singer of European fame, and Amanda
Aldridge, a celebrated composer known by her professional works as
“Montague Ring”, continue to reside in that city.</p>

<p>(Ref.: Work’s Negro Year Book, 1918-1919 edition, pgs. 335).</p>

<p>The name of Samuel Milady (better known as Sam Lucas) will ever go down
in Thespian circles as one of the greatest performers in the old school
of Negro actors. He not only wrote the sensational play of his day, “My
Grandfather’s Clock”, but played its leading role. But his world
popularity and fame were mostly won through his impressive playing of
“Uncle Tom” in the original white “Uncle Tom’s Cabin Company.”</p>

<p>S. Tutt Whitney and J. Homer Tutt, with their “Smarter Set” Co., are to
stageland today what Williams and Walker were with their Company years
ago. The team work of Whitney and Tutt is without doubt the most
wonderful combination of versatile comedy acting put forth over the
footlights within the past ten years. They produce and act their own
compositions to full houses whenever and wherever they perform, and one
of their latest hits is “Bamboula.”</p>

<p>A Colored comedian who is in a class by himself is the many-sided Billy
King. His ability to make people laugh without tickling them in their
ribs or even on their knees is nationally known. Beside being a genius
in acting, he is versatile composer of over a hundred stage productions
in which he has played the leading parts in scores of them. His show is
such a financial success that it is said he annually pays over two
hundred thousand dollars as salaries to the half hundred or more people
in his employment. Billy King is without doubt the greatest individual
producer-performer of high-class musical comedy in the Negro race today.
He is also one of those (scarce-as-hen-teeth) human beings on earth who
seems to have been born under certain stars whose horoscopic influences
magnetize dollars from every place and steadily drop them into his
pockets whether he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span> working or playing. For Mr. King is just as
financially successful in his insurance company and other business
seriousness as he is in his theatrical fun making.</p>

<p>Two of the leading moving picture actors among the American Colored
people are: Noble Johnson who has appeared in such national reels as
“Intolerance” and “The Death Warrant”, and Donald Lashley who has acted
and posed for pictures with Alice Joyce, played forty-five weeks with
Billie Burke in “Caesar’s Wife”, and took part in “The Passion Flower”
with Norma Talmadge. During the four years he has been acting for the
screens he has played in company with many other white moving picture
stars.</p>

<p>According to an article that appeared in the May 27, 1921 issue of the
Negro Star of Wichita, Kansas, Colored people in America own and operate
seven film companies producing pictures with Negro casts. One of these
companies is The Lincoln Motion Picture Company, which is incorporated
in California and has been producing moving picture films for the past
five years. Negro actors and actresses are wholly featured in its reels
that are shown in Colored theatres and other institutions throughout the
United States. Among its star reel features are: “Realization of a
Negro’s Ambition”, “The Trooper of Troop K.” “Law of Nature” and “By
Right of Birth.” The Micheaux Film Corporation, Chicago, Ill., is
another nationally known moving picture producer. The founder and
president of this company is Oscar Micheaux, who is recognized as
America’s foremost Negro producer. His chief productions are “The
Brute”, “The Homesteader”, “The Gunsaulus Mystery”, “The Symbol of The
Unconquered” and “Within Our Gates”.</p>

<p>Some of the leading Colored moving picture stars of today are: Dick
Abrams, Jack Austin, L. De Bulger, Jim Burris, Lawrence Chenault, Louise
Dunbar, Iris Hall, Evelyn Preer, E. G. Tatum, Walker Thompson, Lee
Whipper and Mattie Wilkes, W. H. Herman.</p>

<p>Right here before the facts again slips from the writer’s mind, must be
mentioned two actors, the late Tom Brown and Ernest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span> Hogan. On account
of their seemingly unlimited theatrical abilities, their earnestness in
performing and their cheerful and lovable dispositions, those two were
among the best and most popular actors during their times.</p>

<p>S. H. Dudley aside from having shone in the center of the actor’s
spotlight when taking active parts on the stage, has become one of
America’s leading Colored theatrical promoters, builders and managers in
the country. He is owner or part owner of theatres in Washington, D.C.,
Petersburg, Va. and other cities. In theatrical circles the name of
Dudley is as familiar and popular among Colored people as the name of
Keith is among white people.</p>

<p>“The King Pin of ’em all” (A humorous and fitting description made by
the “Old Roll Top Desk Man, With the Million Dollar Smile”) is Charles
S. Gilpin the world-famed dramatic actor, who was given the highest
thespian honors of the season on Broadway.</p>

<p>“Never in the history of the stage has an actor been accorded the class
of press notices handed Gilpin during his present engagement. What he
did in a dramatic way in “Abraham Lincoln” attracted the plaudits of the
critics of the metropolitan press; but his wonderful work in “The
Emperor Jones” has more than eclipsed anything seen on Broadway in many
years. Indeed, some writers claim that never before has a character been
portrayed in as graphic a manner as is the title role in Gilpin’s
present vehicle.” The above is an extract taken from an article that
appeared in the March 26, 1921 issue of the Chicago Defender and which
article was written by Tony Langston, Dramatic Editor and Advertising
Manager of that paper.</p>

<p>To the thoughtless observer the sudden leap to fame by this Colored
actor looked like a streak of good luck: but not so. Years ago when
Gilpin was working as a coal miner, butler, porter and many other menial
jobs he was, perhaps unknown to even himself, making preparations to
face some big event that his elevating aspirations pushed him on to
meet. He was an actor then, but he had not found himself and his talents
were undeveloped. When he organized the first Lafayette dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span>
players in New York many years ago he was beginning to find and unfold
himself. This unfolding continued for sometime until he was given a cast
in John Drinkwater’s “Abraham Lincoln.” Then (what Gilpin knew for years
but did not get a chance to show) the nation learned that in this man
were the qualities and abilities of a great actor. So when the big
opportunity came for Gilpin to play the principal actor in Eugene
O’Neill’s play, “The Emperor Jones”, this Colored man’s previous years
of hard struggles in and out of his avenues of cherished hopes had well
equipped him for the place. Chance may have put him there, but luck did
not keep him there. Only long preparations and the proper qualifications
that are allied with those preparations can balance and keep a man on
such a high and dizzy steeple point as that, and also enable him to hold
a Spingarn Medal.</p>

<p>Some of the other Colored actors and actresses in America who have
mounted high enough upon the Thespian ladder to catch glimpses of its
topmost rung and are rapidly climbing thereto, are; Dick Abrams, George
Allen, Mrs. Chas. Anderson, Chas. Anderson, Emmett Anthony, Austin &amp;
Delaney, “Chick” Beaman, Andrew Bishop, “Eubie” Blake, Laura Bowman,

<p>“According to J. A. Jackson, of the Billboard, Negroes support 328
Vaudeville and 611 motion pictures theatres in 21 States. The smallest
theatre seats 200 and the largest 1,800. Since September, 1920, 25 new
acts, 14 companies and 12 theatres have entered the field.” The above
quotation is an extract from the July, 1921 issue of The Crisis. John T.
Gibson, Phila., Pa. owner of the New Standard and Dunbar Theaters in
that city, and Rufus G. Byars, Washington, D.C. owner and promoter of a
chain of theaters, are recognized as two of the most successful
theatrical owners and promoters in the Negro Race today.</p>

<p>The writer presents the following names as being only a few belonging to
the many many foremost Colored theatrical owners, managers, promoters,
editors, writers and critics, who are using their utmost talents and
energies to inspire and present intelligent entertainment and clean,
wholesome amusement for the Colored theatre goers:</p>

<p>C. P. Bailey, Clarence Bennett, E. C. Brown, Romeo L. Dougherty, E. B.
Dudley, S. H. Dudley, C. H. Douglass, Hubert H. Harrison, H. J. Huey,
Jas. A. Jackson, Geor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240">{240}</a></span>gia H. Jones, Tony Langston, F. M. Murray, A. B.
Nordecai, E. L. Pankey, Sam E. Reevin, W. S. Scales, Jesse Shipp, Milton
Starr, E. S. Stone, W. J. Styles, C. H. Turpin, Lester B. Walton, and G.
Grant Williams, Deacon Johnson.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest collective sign of the rapid and wonderful progress
made along executive lines by Colored theatrical promoters and
performers in America is seen in the formation of at least three big
organizations pertaining to their own management and welfare.</p>

<p>The National Managers’ Protective Association is an organization to
encourage the progress and promote the welfare of all connected with the
Negro stage. Three of its chief duties are; first, to see that Negro
players be encouraged in every way to entersperse their acts with clean,
worth while offerings in songs and new material; secondly, to agree to
such arrangements that the booking exchange, will give acts contracts
that will be played as given, eliminating lay-offs, with shortest
possible jumps, and salary in keeping, and thirdly, to arbitrate all
complaints of managers, actors or agents, and see that a just settlement
is given the parties, each case to be decided upon its merits. The
officers of this organ are as follows: President C. H. Turpin, of the
Booker T. Washington Theatre, St. Louis, Mo., Vice-President, E. B.
Dudley, of the Dudley Theatre, Detroit, Mich., and Secretary-Treasurer,
T. S. Finley of the Lyceum Theatre, Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>

<p>The Theatre Owners’ Booking Association by its own name implies what its
chief duties are, and it is only necessary to say that the rapidly
increasing numbers of theatre managers who are joining this association
in order to be assured of regular and best plays being booked for their
houses, vividly shows the necessity and value of such an organ. Its
President is Milton Starr, Nashville, Tenn., Vice-President, C. H.
Turpin, St. Louis, Mo., Secretary, W. S. Scales, Winston-Salem, N. C.,
and Treasurer-Manager, S. E. Reevin, Chattanooga, Tenn.</p>

<p>A most recent organization along these lines is known as The Actors’
Legion with headquarters at Cincinnati, Ohio. Its membership is to be
composed of actors and actresses.., and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241">{241}</a></span> of its chief duties is to
see that matters of importance to performers will be speedily and
properly adjusted. The writer was not able to get a list of the names
belonging to the officers of this body.</p>

<p>Tony Langston, born in Detroit, Michigan, (fortunately several years
after Noah’s Flood and a few years before Volstead’s Drought) and today
living in Chicago never very far from nor out of sight of “Dear Old
State Street”, is without question the most popular Colored theatrical
writer not only in America but throughout the world. He writes the
widest variety of subjects of any present-day penman in that line and is
read by more than one million people each and every week. Nine years ago
he entered the establishment of the Chicago Defender by way of its back
door and on a salary less than the devil (printer’s) himself receives.
To-day, he (Tony, not the devil) walks in and out the front doors of
this firm as the highest paid writer in the history of Colored
journalism.</p>

<p>When he first took hold of the dramatic sheet of this paper and held it
up before the sun (son&mdash;excuse the pun), he could see just about as much
matter on it as is seen in the hole (whole) of a doughnut. Since then he
has been constantly thumping and pounding on Colored theatrical Boards
with such hard and well-aimed blows (not with hammers and nails, but
with ability, hard work, tact, cheerfulness, sympathy, friendliness and
a “Million Dollar Smile”) that to-day the dramatic construction of the
Chicago Defender averages over thirty thousand dollars yearly in
advertising.</p>

<p>Aside from being Advertising Manager of the above mentioned journal,
which is popularly known as the “World’s Greatest Weekly”, this
all-round journalist, who is fondly called the “Old Roll Top Desk Man,”
holds similar positions in connection with the Avenue, Grand, States,
Phoenix, Lincoln, Atlas, Monogram, Owl and Pickford Theatres. He is also
President of the Langston Slide and Advertising Company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242">{242}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">F</span>ROM the year 1619 when Negroes were first brought from Africa to the
American Colonies, Colored people had from the very first a few of the
truest kind of friends among a certain class of broad-minded, clean
hearted and Christian white people. This group of people never was in
favor of slavery but they could not stop it because their numbers were
so much smaller than those who wanted and did have slaves. But white
friends of those shackled human beings rapidly increased in numbers
until 1861 when they felt that at last they were not only evenly matched
but also had the sentiment of the rest of the world with them against
the Southern white enemies of the Negro in freedom. Even during the
darkest days of slavery there were white men and women in both the North
and South, who after having slaves given to them by their parents,
became so heavy of heart and worried in mind because of their parts in
such soul damming sins and crimes that they would not longer keep their
Colored people as slaves but set them free. Then again on account of
some valuable deeds or services they had performed, many slaves were
made free outright or were allowed to work their freedom out on easy
terms. Some owners, while they were not quite Christianized or civilized
enough to free their slaves, were in several ways quite kind to them and
sometimes secretly (for the laws of the land forbid owners educating
their slaves) taught them to read and write in somewhat the same amusing
and pitying manner that tender-hearted boys and girls of today are kind
to their pet birds and rabbits and teach them several smart tricks but
yet will not open the cage doors and turn them loose.</p>

<p>Thus in the above ways there were during the whole period of slavery in
the colonies a certain number of Negroes who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span> secured their freedom
as well as good educations in many instances. This explains how it is
possible for the writer to truthfully mention within these pages
historical facts relative to certain Colored people becoming noted
teachers, preachers, doctors, newspaper editors, etc., long before the
Civil War and the freedom of all Negroes in America.</p>

<p>Through the agencies of such organizations and societies as named below
thousands of Northern white people either by means of their money or
through actual service among the Colored people in the South showed
their unquestioned friendships for the Negro race. Some of the most
important of those friendly organs were as follows:</p>

<p>“Freedman’s Bureau, American Missionary Association, The American
Freedmen’s Union Commission, The Baltimore Association for the Moral
Educational Improvement of the colored people, The Western Freedmen’s
Aid Commission, National Freedmen’s Relief Association of the District
of Columbia, The Soldiers’ Memorial Society of Boston, Old School
General Assembly Presbyterian Church, American Baptist Home Mission
Society, The New England Yearly Meeting of Friends, and The Pennsylvania
Friends’ Freedmen’s Relief Association of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The two Presidents of the United States who have proved themselves,
through both words and deeds, truly to have been the greatest white
friends the Negro race has ever had in the White House were Abraham
Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.</p>

<p>The following are a few names handed to the writer by capable estimators
as being among the many thousands of America’s “real white” people, who,
either before or during the Civil War, Reconstruction Period or during
the present times, have shown by their encouraging and fearless words
and their generous and helpful deeds that they had or have within them
the deepest brotherhood interest for the truest humane welfare and
progress of the Negro Race:</p>

<h3>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</h3>

<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has its
headquarters in New York City. This organization was fittingly
originated in 1909 at a banquet celebrating the one-hundredth
anniversary of the birth of the immortal Abraham Lincoln. The one who
made the first move for its organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span> was a white woman, Miss Mary
White Ovington, who is recognized today as the Harriet Beecher Stowe of
her race. She is a graduate of Radcliffe College and is the author of
several books. It has been greatly through her untiring and helpful
efforts that this organ now has in America, Canada, Canal Zone and
Philippine Islands nearly four hundred branches that have a membership
of over one hundred thousand. At this writing the association is
conducting a campaign for the securing of two hundred fifty thousand
members. The true steering rudder of this tremendous ark of safety is in
the steady hands of Moorfield Storey, who as its pilot is being ably
assisted in accurately compassing all rightful courses by his keen-eyed
lookout crew that is composed of Robt. W. Bagnall, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois,
Archibald H. Grimke, Rev. John H. Holmes, Mrs. Addie W. Hunton, Bishop
John Hurst, Jas. Weldon Johnson, Miss Mary White Ovington, William
Pickens, Arthur B. Spingarn, J. E. Spingarn, Mrs. Mary B. Talbert,
Oswald Garrison Villard and Walter White.</p>

<p>The work of this association is best explained in the following matter
which is a copy of one of its programs:</p>

<h3>Done in 1920</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Anti-Lynching.&mdash;Had introduced in both the House and the Senate
anti-lynching measures, as a result of which it is expected that
Congress will enact laws making lynching a federal offense.</p>

<p>2. The Vote.&mdash;Took the matter of disfranchisement of colored voters
in the South before the House Committee on the Census; introduced
evidence to prove the denial of the right to vote by terrorization
and other means; demanded the fair and impartial enforcement of
election laws in the southern states, or the reduction of
representation wherever the right to vote is denied.</p>

<p>3. Haiti.&mdash;American misrule in the black republic of Haiti was
brought into the light of pitiless publicity, forcing investigation
by the Navy Department and resulting in the introduction in the
Senate and House of bills providing for Congressional
investigation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247">{247}</a></span></p>

<p>4. Legal Defense.&mdash;Defended Arkansas riot victims and had their
cases appealed; 6 of the 12 men condemned to death granted new
trials on constitutional grounds; Robert L. Hill, charged with
being the chief “conspirator” in these riots, freed. Extradition of
Tom Ray from Michigan to Georgia fought. Numerous civil rights
cases contested by the branches.</p>

<p>5. Ku Klux Klan.&mdash;A campaign was begun against the revived Ku Klux
Klan, which eventually put the Klan on the defensive.</p>

<p>6. Publicity.&mdash;The most formidable weapon for fighting wrong and
injustice is publicity. Placed The Crisis each month before more
than 350,000 readers. Sent 131 press releases to more than 500
white and colored papers all over the country. Sent out 220,550
leaflets and pamphlets.</p></div>

<h3>Program for 1921</h3>

<div class="blockquot1"><p>1. Anti-Lynching legislation by Congress.</p>

<p>2. Abolition of Segregation in the Departments at Washington.</p>

<p>3. Enfranchisement of the Negro in the South or reduction of
southern representation, if necessary.</p>

<p>4. Restoration of Haitian Independence and Reparation, as far as
possible for wrongs committed there by the American administration,
through Congressional investigation of both military and civil acts
of the American occupation.</p>

<p>5. Presentation to the New President of a mammoth petition of say,
100,000 bona fide signers, collected by the various branches,
requesting the pardon of the soldiers of the 24th Infantry
imprisoned at Leavenworth on the charge of rioting at Houston,

<h3>National Urban League</h3>

<p>Another organization that is second to none in its usefulness and
helpfulness to the America Colored people is the National Urban League
for Social Service Among Negroes. This body was formed in 1911 and is
also under the guidance of one of the staunchest white friends the Race
has in the person of L. Hollingsworth Wood. His keen foresight discovers
and leaves no stone unturned in bringing about for Colored people
throughout the country fair chances to work in new lines of industry and
be accorded just privileges to live in sanitary and comfortable
quarters. This league has branches in more than thirty cities where
thousands of Colored people yearly receive social and industrial
helpfulness of the most encouraging nature. Few people know the full
value of the tremendous work this league is doing and of the rapid
growth it is making.</p>

<p>Those who are, as the chief officers in this league, wisely and
unstintingly giving their time and efforts to aid Mr. Wood in this great
work are W. H. Baldwin, A. S. Frissell, A. L. Jackson, E. K. Jones, Dr.
R. R. Moton, Kelly Miller, John T. Emlen, J. C. Thomas and Lillian A.
Turner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_249" id="page_249">{249}</a></span></p>

<p>Praiseworthy and thankful mention should be made on these pages
regarding the backboned manhoods and Christian stands for protection and
justice to Colored people three Southern governors have fearlessly taken
within the past two years.</p>

<p>In July 1920, Governor Thos. W. Bickett of North Carolina sent the State
Militia, under Capt. M. P. Fowler, to Graham, N. C. with orders to halt
and prevent a white mob from breaking into jail and lynching three Negro
prisoners. After the troops had arrived and were placed on guard the mob
advanced on the jail to secure the prisoners but were halted and
scattered by the militia’s machine gun that killed one and wounded three
of the would-be lynchers.</p>

<p>During March 1921, Governor Edwin P. Morrow of Kentucky removed from
office the white jailer, J. H. Edgar for allowing a white mob to enter
the jail and lynch Richard James a Colored prisoner. This Governor also
offered a reward of one thousand five hundred dollars for the capture
and conviction of each member of the mob.</p>

<p>Right on the heels of the exposure and arrest of the Georgia white
planter, J. S. Williams, who was convicted in April 1921 for the murder
of Lindsey Peterson, a Colored laborer on Williams peonage plantation
where the murdered bodies of at least ten other Colored laborers were
found; Governor Hugh M. Dorsey, of Georgia had published and freely
circulated a pamphlet entitled, “The Negro in Georgia.” In this
publication the Governor bravely and in detail tells of 135 incidents of
cruelties committed upon Georgia Negroes. In only two of these cases
were the victims accused of crimes against white women. The remaining
133 exposures tell of the whippings, shootings, lynchings, and the
enslavement of Colored laborers under the forced labor systems, as well
as the driving away of wealthy Colored people from their homes by bodily
abuses or threatened tortures.</p>

<p>When it is taken into consideration that those officials fully knew that
their stands against and exposures of such savage behaviors of their own
people would without doubt mean their political deaths, as well as
making for themselves state wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_250" id="page_250">{250}</a></span> enemies who would not hesitate to do
them physical harm; the acts of those Governors were really those of
heroes. In performing their full official and Christian duties, they
have already influenced many other Southern officials to come forward
like real men and help to wash away from the South (especially Georgia)
its world-wide stain and shame.</p>

<p>During the past twenty years, Hon. Joseph C. Manning of Alabama, because
of his continued courageous stands and his mighty platform and pen
fights for justice to the Colored people, especially in the South, has
constantly proved himself one of the most fearless and truest white
friends the Negro race has in America today. In the April 23, 1921 issue
of the Chicago Defender there was republished the article “Let Him Have
Due Credit” that appeared in the April 16, 1921 issue of The Washington
Bee. The article in part says:</p>

<p>“The peonage conditions in Georgia and the trail that has been going on
down there recalls that it was Hon. Joseph C. Manning of Alabama who
first brought peonage conditions in Alabama and the South to national
attention and into national discussion.</p>

<p>“A letter written by Mr. Manning to the New York Evening Post in 1903
not only assailed this condition but named the peonage perpetrators. The
Literary Digest made a review of the newspaper comment the article
aroused. The papers in Alabama, some of them, vilified Mr. Manning
unmercifully. He was denounced as a “defamer of his state”, branded as a
liar, the peonage conditions were denied; but, in not a great while, the
citizens he named were prosecuted and convicted through the operations
of the Department of Justice when Mr. Moody was Attorney General.</p>

<p>“In the matter of peonage, as well as in the showing up of “black belt”
frauds in the South, it was none other than Hon. Joseph C. Manning who
took the initiative and has stood the burden to follow for having stood
for right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_251" id="page_251">{251}</a></span></p>

<p>“Precisely as he fought “black belt” frauds, helping to unseat Southern
members of Congress in 1897, he has kept on fighting disfranchisement
and arraigned lynching and all sorts of mobs and mob government.</p>

<p>“President Harding, when in the United States Senate, was called on
frequently by Mr. Manning, who discussed these wrongs with the man who
was to become President. The Bee then followed the work being done, in
1917, right here in Washington by Mr. Manning. No man, more than the
President of the United States, knows about this self-sacrificing labor
of Mr. Manning for right and for justice.”</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> As the result of her being kind, courteous and considerate
of the feelings of respectable Colored people with whom she came in
contact and her writing against slavery in Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the name
of Harriet Beecher Stowe stands today as the most widely known and
famous women authoress the world had ever known. During the first year
her book was published over 100 editions appeared, and up to the present
time it is said that at least two million copies of it have been sold
throughout the United States and foreign countries. Aside from the
English language, it has been issued in over a score of other civilized
languages. It is estimated as being the most popularly read book in the
world with the exception of the Bible. It has been just as successfully
produced on the stage and since its first publication in book form in
1852, it has continued to hold its popularity as no other book has ever
done for such a period of years with the exception of the Bible. It is
estimated that during just the first year Uncle Tom’s Cabin was
published its authoress received at least $50,000 as royalties from its
sales.
</p><p>
This is how the unknown and poor but mannerly refined, highly cultured,
sensibly educated and broad-minded white lady, Mrs. Harriet Beecher
Stowe, made for herself everlasting fame, immortalized her name and at
the same time reaped an independent fortune; just by sowing seeds of
consideration and kindness among, looking upon and treating as God’s
human beings and full-fledged American citizens the Colored people in
the United States
</p><p>
As the above were the earthly rewards the hearts of weak and sinful
mankind were softened and melted enough to give to Mrs. Stowe, just
think of the indescribable rewards the always loving heart of the strong
and pure Almighty God is today bestowing upon her in Heaven with Him.</p></div>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
